Ashur-nadin-apli: Aššūr-nādin-apli, inscribed maš-šur-SUM-DUMU.UŠ, was king of Assyria (1207 BC – 1204 BC or 1196 BC – 1194 BC short chronology). The alternate dating is due to uncertainty over the length of reign of a later monarch, Ninurta-apal-Ekur, where conflicting king lists differ by ten years. His name meant "Aššur is the giver of an heir" in the Akkadian language. He was a son of Tukulti-Ninurta I.
