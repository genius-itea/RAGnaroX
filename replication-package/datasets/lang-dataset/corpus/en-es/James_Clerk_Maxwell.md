James Clerk Maxwell: James Clerk Maxwell  (13 June 1831 â€“ 5 November 1879) was a Scottish scientist in the field of mathematical physics. His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as different manifestations of the same phenomenon. Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics"  after the first one realised by Isaac Newton.
