Halimede (moon): Halimede is about 62 kilometers in diameter (assuming an albedo of 0.04) and appears neutral (grey) in the visible light. Given the very similar colour of the satellite to that of Nereid together with the high probability (41%) of collision in the past lifespan of the Solar System, it has been suggested that the satellite could be a fragment of Nereid.Halimede, like many of the outer satellites of Neptune, is named after one of the Nereids, the fifty daughters of Nereus and Doris. Before the announcement of its name on February 3, 2007 (IAUC 8802), Halimede was known by the provisional designation S/2002 N 1.
