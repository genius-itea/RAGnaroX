ActivePresenter: ActivePresenter is a screencasting and eLearning software for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X which can be used to create software demonstrations, software simulations, and quizzes. It allows exporting to a series of images, HTML slideshows, documents (PDF, Microsoft Word, Excel), Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, videos (AVI, MP4, WMV, WebM), Flash videos and interactive simulations (HTML5, Adobe Flash). For eLearning, ActivePresenter can pack exported materials into SCORM or xAPI. For software simulations, it can use mouse hovers, left or right mouse clicks, and key presses with modifier keys.
