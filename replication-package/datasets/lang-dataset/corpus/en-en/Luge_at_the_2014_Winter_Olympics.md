Luge at the 2014 Winter Olympics: 110 athletes from 24 nations are scheduled to participate, with number of athletes in parenthesis. Both Kazakhstan and Tonga (also making its Winter Olympics debut) marked their first Olympic appearances in the sport. India's athlete competed as an Independent Olympic Participants, as the Indian Olympic Association was suspended by the International Olympic Committee; the suspension was later lifted, but not before India's athlete had already competed under the Independent Olympic Participant banner. IOC decision to disqualify Russia was nullified by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
