Sevastopol International Airport: Sevastopol International Airport (Ukrainian: Міжнародний аеропорт Севастополь "Бельбек", (IATA: UKS, ICAO: UKFB) is a military airfield in Belbek, a village near Sevastopol in Crimea. The airfield was first constructed in June 1941, during the third year of World War II. Initially it housed a military fighter aviation unit. Constructed without a hardened runway, after the war the airfield received a concrete runway, but remained exclusively in use by the military. During the second half of the 1980s, after Mikhail Gorbachev came to power, the airfield was significantly increased and improved, as the airfield was to be used by him when travelling to the presidential dacha on the southern coast of the Crimea, near the cape of Foros. Subsequently, it was also allowed to use the airfield for civilian purposes.
