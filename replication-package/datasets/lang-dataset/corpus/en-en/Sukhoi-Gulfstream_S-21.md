Sukhoi-Gulfstream S-21: In the early 1990s, Gulfstream Aerospace and the Sukhoi Design Bureau began a joint effort to develop a supersonic small business jet, code named the S-21. Due to questionable market demand for commercial supersonic air travel, commitment to the project weakened and delays mounted.Gulfstream eventually dissolved the partnership, although Sukhoi continued work on the S-21.
