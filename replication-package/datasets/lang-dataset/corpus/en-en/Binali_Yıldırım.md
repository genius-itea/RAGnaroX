Binali Yıldırım: On 5 May 2016, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu announced that he would be stepping down as AKP leader and would not stand as a candidate in the subsequent party leadership election. The announcement came after several days of speculation that relations between Davutoğlu and Erdoğan had declined significantly over the latter's insistence of an executive presidency system of government that would have seen Davutoğlu's office effectively abolished. In April 2016, a WordPress blog named the Pelican files were released by unnamed supporters of Erdoğan, detailing 27 different points of disagreement between the two men. These included Davutoğlu's domestic and foreign policies, disagreements over the AKP's election candidate lists for the June 2015 general election and concerns that Davutoğlu was attempting to establish his own support base in rival to Erdoğan. A similar disagreement between Erdoğan and Davutoğlu regarding the unified candidate list for the party Central Executive Committee during the 5th AKP Ordinary Congress in 2015 almost prompted Yıldırım to run against him.
