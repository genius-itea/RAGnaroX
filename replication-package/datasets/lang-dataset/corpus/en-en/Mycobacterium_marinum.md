Mycobacterium marinum: Although Aronson isolated this mycobacterium in 1926 from a fish, it was not until 1951 that it was found to be the cause of human disease by Linell and Norden. Large outbreaks of infection due to this atypical mycobacterium have been described in association with swimming. Infections related to swimming pools have now drastically fallen due to the improvements in the construction and maintenance of these facilities.The first case of M. marinum infection associated with a fish-tank ('fish-tank granuloma') was reported in 1962 by Swift and Cohen. M. marinum infection may be an occupational hazard for certain professions such as pet shop workers, but most infections occur in fish fanciers who keep an aquarium at home. Although infection may be caused by direct injury from the fish fins or bites, most are acquired during the handling of the aquariums such as cleaning or changing the water. Indirect infection has also been described related to a childâ€™s bathing utensils that had been used to clean a fish tank. Due to an increased awareness of the disease and improved isolation methods, more and more cases are being recognized and reported worldwide.
