Upload: Remote uploading is used by some online file hosting services. It is also used when the local computer has a slow connection to the remote systems, but they have a fast connection between them. Without remote uploading functionality, the data would have to first be downloaded to the local host and then uploaded to the remote file hosting server, both times over slow connections.
