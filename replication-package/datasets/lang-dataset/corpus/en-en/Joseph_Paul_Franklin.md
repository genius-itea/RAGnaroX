Joseph Paul Franklin: Franklin was convicted of several murders and received six life sentences, as well as the death sentence. He also confessed to the attempted murders of magazine publisher Larry Flynt in 1978 and civil rights activist Vernon Jordan in 1980. Both survived their injuries, but Flynt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down. Franklin was not convicted in either of those highly publicized cases, and his confessions came years after the crimes occurred.
