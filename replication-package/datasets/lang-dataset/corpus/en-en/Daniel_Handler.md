Daniel Handler: Handler was born in San Francisco, California, the son of Sandra Handler (n√©e Walpole) a retired City College of San Francisco Dean, and Louis Handler, an accountant. His father was a Jewish refugee from Germany, and he is distantly related to British writer Hugh Walpole through his mother. He has a younger sister, Rebecca Handler.

He graduated from Wesleyan University in 1992. He was awarded the 1992 Connecticut Student Poet Prize, which he claims was earned by ripping off Elizabeth Bishop.
