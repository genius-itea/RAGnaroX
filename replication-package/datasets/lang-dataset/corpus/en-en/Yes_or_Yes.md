Yes or Yes: In early October 2018, advertisements with the phrase "Do you like Twice? Yes or Yes" (Korean: "트와이스 좋아하세요? YES or YES") were put up on subway billboards, drawing attention online. On October 11, JYP Entertainment confirmed that Twice planned to release their third Korean album of the year on November 5. Yes or Yes was revealed as the album's title on October 20 and a special video commemorating Twice's third anniversary contained a short clip of the album's lead single of the same name.
