Spined loach: The spined loach typically reaches an adult length of 8–10 cm (3.1–3.9 in), although females may grow up to 12 cm (4.7 in). Adults weigh between 20–60 g (0.7–2.1 oz). Their backs feature a yellow-brown colouring interspersed with many small grey or brown scales on the spinal ridge.  The scales on the belly are pale yellow or orange.  The body overall is long and thin. There are 6 barbels around the mouth. Under the eyes there is a two-pointed spike, with which the fish can inflict a painful sting.
