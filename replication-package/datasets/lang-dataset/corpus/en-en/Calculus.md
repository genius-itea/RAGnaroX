Calculus: Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.In mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly  devoted to the study of functions and limits. The word calculus (plural calculi) is a  Latin word, meaning originally "small pebble" (this meaning is kept in medicine, see Calculus (medicine)). Because such pebbles were used for calculation, the meaning of the word has evolved for meaning method of computation. It is therefore used for naming specific methods of calculation and related theories, such as propositional calculus, Ricci calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.
