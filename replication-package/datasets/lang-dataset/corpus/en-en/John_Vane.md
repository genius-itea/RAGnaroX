John Vane: Born in Tardebigge, Worcestershire, John Vane was one of three children and grew up in suburban Birmingham. His father, Maurice Vane, was the son of Jewish Russian immigrants and his mother, Frances Vane, came from a Worcestershire farming family.  He attended a local state school from age 5, before moving on to King Edward's School in Edgbaston, Birmingham.  An early interest in chemistry was to prove the inspiration for studying the subject at the University of Birmingham in 1944.
