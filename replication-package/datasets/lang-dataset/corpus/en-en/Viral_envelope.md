Viral envelope: Some viruses (e.g. HIV and many animal viruses) have viral envelopes covering their protective protein capsids.  The envelopes are typically derived from portions of the host cell membranes (phospholipids and proteins), but include some viral glycoproteins. They may help viruses avoid the host immune system.  Glycoproteins on the surface of the envelope serve to identify and bind to receptor sites on the host's membrane.  The viral envelope then fuses with the host's membrane, allowing the capsid and viral genome to enter and infect the host.
