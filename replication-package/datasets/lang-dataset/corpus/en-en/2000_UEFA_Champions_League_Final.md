2000 UEFA Champions League Final: The win was Real's eighth European Cup Championship overall and their second in three years, and was notable for being Vicente del Bosque's first title as manager. It was also a landmark for being the first final played between two teams from the same nation. Upon this win, McManaman became the first English player to win the tournament with a non-English club.
