Curling at the 2014 Winter Olympics: Qualification to the curling tournaments at the Winter Olympics was determined through two methods. Nations could qualify teams by earning qualification points from performances at the 2012 and 2013 World Curling Championships. Teams could also qualify through an Olympic qualification event which was held in the autumn of 2013. Seven nations qualified teams via World Championship qualification points, while two nations qualified through the qualification event. As host nation, Russia qualified teams automatically, thus making a total of ten teams per gender in the curling tournaments.
