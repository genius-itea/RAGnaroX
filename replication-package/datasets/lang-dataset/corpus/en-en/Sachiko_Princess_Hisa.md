Sachiko, Princess Hisa: On 8 March, her medical condition continued to deteriorate and the infant princess died at 3:38 am. The Emperor ordered the army to stop their actions for the day and decreed a day of national mourning. On 13 March, the princess was buried in a simple ceremony in the Toshimagaoka cemetery. The Empress was devastated; she held a doll of about the same size as Sachiko for days and would not have another child for one more year.
