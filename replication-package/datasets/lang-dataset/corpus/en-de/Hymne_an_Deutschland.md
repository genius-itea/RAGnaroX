Hymne an Deutschland: Its lyrics were written by Rudolf Alexander Schröder in 1950. Hermann Reutter composed its tune after Carl Orff, whom Heuss wanted to have as composer, had rejected the request and suggested Reutter instead. Heuss’ attempts failed, and in 1952 he and Chancellor Adenauer recognized the "Deutschlandlied" as the new national anthem, with only the third stanza being sung on official occasions.
