      "\n\nNTSC: The National Television System Committee was established in 1940 by the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to resolve the conflicts between companies over the introduction of a nationwide analog television system in the United States. \nIn March 1941, the committee issued a technical standard for black-and-white television that built upon a 1936 recommendation made by the Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA). \nTechnical advancements of the vestigial side band technique allowed for the opportunity to increase the image resolution. \nThe NTSC selected 525 scan lines as a compromise between RCA's 441-scan line standard (already being used by RCA's NBC TV network) and Philco's and DuMont's desire to increase the number of scan lines to between 605 and 800. \nThe standard recommended a frame rate of 30 frames (images) per second, consisting of two interlaced fields per frame at 262.5 lines per field and 60 fields per second. \nOther standards in the final recommendation were an aspect ratio of 4:3, and frequency modulation (FM) for the sound signal (which was quite new at the time). \nThe actual figure of 525 lines was chosen as a consequence of the limitations of the vacuum-tube-based technologies of the day. \nIn early TV systems, a master voltage-controlled oscillator was run at twice the horizontal line frequency, and this frequency was divided down by the number of lines used (in this case 525) to give the field frequency (60 Hz in this case).

      "\n\nThis frequency was then compared with the 60 Hz power-line frequency and any discrepancy corrected by adjusting the frequency of the master oscillator. \nFor interlaced scanning, an odd number of lines per frame was required in order to make the vertical retrace distance identical for the odd and even fields, which meant the master oscillator frequency had to be divided down by an odd number."

      "\n\nHistory of chemistry: Around 420 BC, Empedocles stated that all matter is made up of four elemental substances: earth, fire, air and water. The early theory of atomism can be traced back to ancient Greece and ancient India. Greek atomism dates back to the Greek philosopher Democritus, who declared that matter is composed of indivisible and indestructible particles called \"atomos\" around 380 BC. Leucippus also declared that atoms were the most indivisible part of matter. This coincided with a similar declaration by Indian philosopher Kanada in his Vaisheshika sutras around the same time period. In much the same fashion he discussed the existence of gases. What Kanada declared by sutra, Democritus declared by philosophical musing. Both suffered from a lack of empirical data. Without scientific proof, the existence of atoms was easy to deny. Aristotle opposed the existence of atoms in 330 BC. Earlier, in 380 BC, a Greek text attributed to Polybus argued that the human body is composed of four humours. Around 300 BC, Epicurus postulated a universe of indestructible atoms in which man himself is responsible for achieving a balanced life.",

      "\n\nTernary computer: One early calculating machine, built by Thomas Fowler entirely from wood in 1840, operated in balanced ternary. \nThe first modern, electronic ternary computer Setun was built in 1958 in the Soviet Union at the Moscow State University by Nikolay Brusentsov, and it had notable advantages over the binary computers which eventually replaced it, such as lower electricity consumption and lower production cost. \nIn 1970 Brusentsov built an enhanced version of the computer, which he called Setun-70.  \nIn the USA, the ternary computing emulator Ternac working on a binary machine was developed in 1973.\nThe ternary computer QTC-1 was developed in Canada. \nWith the advent of mass-produced binary components for computers, ternary computers have diminished in significance. \nHowever, Donald Knuth argues that they will be brought back into development in the future to take advantage of ternary logic's elegance and efficiency. \nOne possible way this could happen is by combining an optical computer with the ternary logic system. \nA ternary computer using fiber optics could use dark as 0 and two orthogonal polarizations of light as 1 and ‚àí1. \nIBM also reports infrequently on ternary computing topics (in its papers), but it is not actively engaged in it.The Josephson junction has been proposed as a balanced ternary memory cell, using circulating superconducting currents, either clockwise, counterclockwise, or off.

They inhabit agricultural fields and grassy areas. They are present in every continent with the exception of Antarctica; by 2014, 107 species had been described and more species are likely to be discovered, especially in Asia. Neoscapteriscus didactylus is a pest species, originating in South America; it has spread to the West Indies and New South Wales in Australia. Gryllotalpa africana is a major pest in South Africa; other Gryllotalpa species are widely distributed in Europe, Asia and Australia. They are native to Britain (as to western Europe), but the former population of G. gryllotalpa may now be extinct in mainland Britain, surviving in the Channel Islands.",
      "\n\nThus, every proton in the nucleus must occupy a quantum state different from all other protons, and the same applies to all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud.A nucleus that has a different number of protons than neutrons can potentially drop to a lower energy state through a radioactive decay that causes the number of protons and neutrons to more closely match. \nAs a result, atoms with matching numbers of protons and neutrons are more stable against decay. \nHowever, with increasing atomic number, the mutual repulsion of the protons requires an increasing proportion of neutrons to maintain the stability of the nucleus, which slightly modifies this trend of equal numbers of protons to neutrons. \nThe scanning tunneling microscope is a device for viewing surfaces at the atomic level. \nIt uses the quantum tunneling phenomenon, which allows particles to pass through a barrier that would normally be insurmountable. \nElectrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on each of which is an adsorbed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. \nScanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a constant current. \nThe calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible.

In vielen L√§ndern wird er als Tag der Liebe oder des gegenseitigen Respekts gefeiert, zum Beispiel durch das Ausgeben von Karten, Schokolade, Blumen oder andere Geschenke.\n\nDie Tradition des Valentinstags stammt aus dem mittelalterlichen Abend der heiligen **Valentus**, einem heiligen Mann, der als Treue und Liebe stand, und wurde sp√§ter durch die mittelalterliche Ehe- und Liebe-Traditionen verfeinert. In den westlichen L√§ndern, wie den USA oder Gro√übritannien, ist der Valentinstag besonders verbreitet, wo er oft als Tag, an dem Menschen ihre Partner oder Freunde lieben und sch√§tzen, feiern.\n\nAber auch in vielen anderen L√§ndern gibt es **eigene Traditionen oder andere Feiertage**, die mit der Liebe oder dem Freundschaftsgef√ºhl verbunden sind:\n\n- In **Israel** wird **Tu B'Av** (der 15. Tag des Monats Av) als j√ºdischer Tag der Liebe gefeiert. Traditionell wurde er im alten Judentum als Tag der Tanz- und Freudefeier gefeiert, und heute wird er auch als \"J√ºdischer Valentinstag\" wahrgenommen.\n- In **Japan** wurde der Valentinstag durch die Werbeaktionen von Morozoff Ltd. im Jahr 1936 popul√§r, und seitdem wird er oft mit Schokolade und dem \"Geschenk an Frauen\" verbunden ‚Äì obwohl es ein Missverst√§ndnis gibt, dass Frauen nur an M√§nner schenken.\n- In **Brazil** wird der Valentinstag nicht gefeiert, da er zu fr√ºh oder zu sp√§t im Jahr f√§llt. Stattdessen wird am **12. Juni** der **D√≠a dos Namorados** (Tag der Liebenden) gefeiert, der oft mit der Suche nach einem Partner verbunden ist.\n- In **China** wird der Valentinstag nicht direkt gefeiert ‚Äì stattdessen wird der **Qixi-Festtag** (der 7. Tag des 7. Monats im chinesischen Kalender) als Tag der Liebe gefeiert, der aus einer Legende √ºber die \"Staubweberin\" und den \"Staubhirten\" stammt.\n- In **Finnland** und **Estland** wird der Valentinstag als **\"Freundes-Tag\"** (Yst√§v√§np√§iv√§ oder S√µbrap√§ev) gefeiert ‚Äì mit Fokus auf Freundschaft statt auf Liebesbeziehungen.\n- In **Guatemala** wird er als **\"D√≠a del Cari√±o\"** (Tag der Liebe) bezeichnet.\n- In **Kolumbien** wird der Tag der Liebe und Freundschaft am **dritten Samstag im September** gefeiert.\n\nSo ist der Valentinstag nicht universell, sondern in vielen Kulturen mit eigenen, spezifischen Traditionen verbunden ‚Äì manchmal sogar mit einer anderen Bedeutung als \"Liebe zwischen Ehepartnern\", sondern vielmehr mit **Freundschaft, gemeinsamer Freude oder dem Wunsch, sich zu zeigen**.\n\nWenn du m√∂chtest, kann ich dir auch eine kurze Zusammenfassung in einer Tabelle oder eine Liste mit L√§ndern und Traditionen geben! üíå",

      "\n\nAmigo Secreto is also popular there. \nIn Israel, the Jewish tradition of Tu B'Av has been revived and transformed into the Jewish equivalent of Valentine's Day. \nIt is celebrated on the 15th day of the month of Av (usually in late August). \nIn ancient times girls would wear white dresses and dance in the vineyards, where the boys would be waiting for them (Mishna Taanith end of Chapter 4). \nToday, Tu B'Av is celebrated as a second holiday of love by secular people (along with Valentine's Day), and it shares many of the customs associated with Saint Valentine's Day in western societies. \nIn modern Israeli culture Tu B'Av is a popular day to proclaim love, propose marriage, and give gifts like cards or flowers. \nIn Japan, Morozoff Ltd. introduced the holiday for the first time in 1936, when it ran an advertisement aimed at foreigners. \nLater, in 1953, it began promoting the giving of heart-shaped chocolates; other Japanese confectionery companies followed suit thereafter. \nIn 1958, the Isetan department store ran a \"Valentine sale\". \nFurther campaigns during the 1960s popularized the custom.The custom that only women give chocolates to men may have originated from the translation error of a chocolate-company executive during the initial campaigns. \nIn particular, office ladies give chocolate to their co-workers.

      "\n\nIn Finland, Valentine's Day is called yst√§v√§np√§iv√§ which translates into \"Friend's Day\". \nAs the name indicates, this day is more about remembering friends, not significant others. \nIn Estonia, Valentine's Day is called s√µbrap√§ev, which has the same meaning. \nIn Guatemala it is known as the \"D√≠a del Cari√±o\" (Affection Day). \nSome countries, in particular the Dominican Republic and El Salvador, have a tradition called Amigo secreto (\"Secret friend\"), which is a game similar to the Christmas tradition of Secret Santa.In Brazil, the Dia dos Namorados (lit. \n\"Lovers' Day\", or \"Boyfriends'/Girlfriends' Day\") is celebrated on June 12, probably because that is the day before Saint Anthony's day, known there as the marriage saint, when traditionally many single women perform popular rituals, called simpatias, in order to find a good husband or boyfriend. \nCouples exchange gifts, chocolates, cards, and flower bouquets. \nThe February 14 Valentine's Day is not celebrated at all because it usually falls too little before or too little after the Brazilian Carnival ‚Äì that can fall anywhere from early February to early March and lasts almost a week. \nBecause of the absence of Valentine's Day and due to the celebrations of the Carnivals, Brazil was recommended by U.S. \nNews & World Report as a tourist destination during February for Western singles who want to get away from the holiday.Colombia celebrates D√≠a del amor y la amistad on the third Saturday in September instead.

During this period he investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum produced by a prism could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.He showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour. From 1978 until 1988, an image of Newton designed by Harry Ecclestone appeared on Series D ¬£1 banknotes issued by the Bank of England (the last ¬£1 notes to be issued by the Bank of England).

The word calculus (plural calculi) is a  Latin word, meaning originally \"small pebble\" (this meaning is kept in medicine, see Calculus (medicine)).

Wenn du beispielsweise auf eine spezifische Kolonie anspielst, wie z.‚ÄØB. **Frankreichs Franz√∂sisch-Guiana** oder **Deutsch-S√ºdwestafrika**, dann kann ich dir eine genauere Antwort geben.\n\nIn deinem Kontext gibt es folgende Hinweise:\n\n- **Franz√∂sisch-Guiana**: Die Strafkolonie in Franz√∂sisch-Guiana wurde nicht als eigenst√§ndige Einheit gegr√ºndet, sondern war Teil des franz√∂sischen Kolonialsystems. Die Anwendung von Strafgefangenen im Kolonialkontext begann bereits im 17. Jahrhundert, aber die gr√∂√üere Nutzung von Strafgefangenen f√ºr den Bau und die Landwirtschaft in Franz√∂sisch-Guiana erfolgte im 19. Jahrhundert. Der Text sagt: ‚ÄûAt first, only those freed prisoners who could raise the fare for their return passage to France were able to go home‚Äú, was darauf hindeutet, dass die Strafgefangenen bereits im 19. Jahrhundert in der Kolonie waren.\n\n- **Deutsch-S√ºdwestafrika**: Dieses Gebiet war kein Straf- oder Arbeitskolonie im Sinne von Strafgefangenen, sondern ein Kolonialgebiet mit einer sehr kleinen deutschen Bev√∂lkerung (ca. 2.600 Deutsche). Es wurde 1884 von Deutschland eingenommen, aber es war kein Straf- oder Arbeitskolonie.\n\n- **Westaustralien**: Hier wurde zu Beginn eine ‚Äûfree colony‚Äú (freie Kolonie) eingerichtet, sp√§ter dann auch britische Strafgefangene aufgenommen, um einen Arbeitsmangel zu beheben. Das bedeutet, dass die Einf√ºhrung von Strafgefangenen in Westaustralien erst sp√§ter, im 19. Jahrhundert, erfolgte.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è **Zusammenfassung**:\nEs gibt keine einheitliche Gr√ºndungsjahr f√ºr alle Strafkolonien. Wenn du auf **Franz√∂sisch-Guiana** anspielst, dann war die Nutzung von Strafgefangenen im 19. Jahrhundert bereits verbreitet, aber die koloniale Entwicklung reicht zur√ºck bis ins 17.

Nachdem Berkman 1907 die Redaktion von *Mother Earth* √ºbernahm, war Goldman in diesem Zeitraum weiterhin ein zentrales Mitglied des anarchistischen Bewegungsbildes.\n\nAls Berkman zur√ºckkehrte, hatte Goldman bereits eine neue Phase in ihrem Engagement begonnen:  \n- Sie trat als Delegierte der US-amerikanischen Anarchisten zum **Internationalen Anarchisten-Kongress in Amsterdam** 1907 bei.  \n- Sie war ein starker Vertreter f√ºr **freie Liebe**, **frauenrechte**, **homosexuelle Rechte** und **Freiheit von staatlicher Kontrolle**.  \n- Sie gr√ºndete und leitete *Mother Earth*, eine wichtige anarchistische Zeitschrift, die als Plattform f√ºr radikale Gedanken diente.  \n- Sie sprach vor gro√üen Publikumsmassen und f√∂rderte die Ideen der **anarcha-feministischen Bewegung**, die den Patriarchat und die sozialen Strukturen kritisierte.\n\nBerkman war zwar nach seiner Entlassung aus der Gefangenschaft emotional und sozial durch die Erfahrung mit der Praxis der staatlichen Gewalt beeinflusst, aber seine R√ºckkehr zum Leben in den USA war nicht direkt eine Fortsetzung der fr√ºheren Beziehung zu Goldman ‚Äì vielmehr war es ein Zeitpunkt, an dem beide ihre eigenen, unabh√§ngigen Wege einschlugen.  \n\nGoldman blieb jedoch aktiv, und ihre Arbeit wurde nach wie vor von den Anarchisten als zentraler Inspiration gesehen.\n\nFazit:  \n**Nein, Goldman war nicht ‚Äûweiterhin‚Äú in der Art, wie ‚Äûer‚Äú es tat.**  \n**Sie war aktiv und unvermindert weiterhin t√§tig ‚Äì und ihre Rolle wuchs.**  \n\nWenn du m√∂chtest, kann ich dir auch eine klare Zusammenfassung von Goldman‚Äôs wichtigsten Leistungen und Positionen geben ‚Äì besonders im Kontext von Frauen- und Sexualfreedom.",

      "\n\nThroughout Pitt's ministry, George supported many of Pitt's political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt's supporters in the House of Lords. \nDuring and after Pitt's ministry, George III was extremely popular in Britain. \nThe British people admired him for his piety, and for remaining faithful to his wife. \nHe was fond of his children, and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy in 1782 and 1783 respectively. \nNevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. \nThey were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning, and to lead lives of religious observance and virtue. \nWhen his children strayed from George's own principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed and disappointed.By this time George's health was deteriorating. \nHe had a mental illness, characterised by acute mania, which was possibly a symptom of the genetic disease porphyria, although this has been questioned. \nA study of samples of the King's hair published in 2005 revealed high levels of arsenic, a possible trigger for the disease. \nThe source of the arsenic is not known, but it could have been a component of medicines or cosmetics. \nThe King may have had a brief episode of disease in 1765, but a longer episode began in the summer of 1788. \nAt the end of the parliamentary session, he went to Cheltenham Spa to recuperate. ",
      "\n\nAfter visiting the orphanage with Pitt in November 2006, Jolie applied for adoption as a single parent, because Vietnam's adoption regulations do not allow unmarried couples to co-adopt. \nAfter their return to the U.S., she petitioned the court to change her son's surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was approved on May 31. \nPitt subsequently adopted Pax on February 21, 2008.\nAt the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. \nFor the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, France, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade. \nShe gave birth to a son, Knox L√©on, and a daughter, Vivienne Marcheline, on July 12, 2008. \nThe first pictures of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to People and Hello! \nfor a reported $14 million‚Äîthe most expensive celebrity photographs ever taken. \nAll proceeds were donated to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation. \nJolie committed to acting professionally at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that her demeanor was \"too dark.\" \nShe appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television, as well as in several music videos, namely Lenny Kravitz's \"Stand by My Woman\" (1991), Antonello Venditti's \"Alta Marea\" (1991), The Lemonheads's \"It's About Time\" (1993), and Meat Loaf's \"Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through\" (1993). ",
      "\n\nShe explained that she had abandoned her family when Zahara became sick, and said she thought Zahara was \"very fortunate\" to have been adopted by Jolie. \nJolie was accompanied by her partner, Brad Pitt, when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara. \nShe later indicated that they had together made the decision to adopt from Ethiopia, having first visited the country earlier that year. \nAfter Pitt announced his intention to adopt her children, she filed a petition to legally change their surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was granted on January 19, 2006. \nPitt adopted Maddox and Zahara soon after.In an attempt to avoid the unprecedented media frenzy surrounding their relationship, Jolie and Pitt traveled to Namibia for the birth of their first biological child. \nOn May 27, 2006, she gave birth to a daughter, Shiloh Nouvel, in Swakopmund. \nThey sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images with the aim of benefiting charity, rather than allowing paparazzi to take these valuable photographs. \nPeople and Hello! \npurchased the North American and British rights to the images for $4.1 and $3.5 million respectively, a record in celebrity photojournalism at that time, with all proceeds donated to UNICEF.On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a son, three-year-old Pax Thien, from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. \nHe was born as Pham Quang Sang on November 29, 2003, in HCMC, where he was abandoned by his biological mother soon after birth.

      "\n\nIn the opinion of modern scholars, during the long reign of George III the monarchy continued to lose its political power, and grew as the embodiment of national morality. \nGeorge III is often accused of obstinately trying to keep Great Britain at war with the revolutionaries in America, despite the opinions of his own ministers. \nIn the words of the Victorian author George Trevelyan, the King was determined \"never to acknowledge the independence of the Americans, and to punish their contumacy by the indefinite prolongation of a war which promised to be eternal.\" \nThe King wanted to \"keep the rebels harassed, anxious, and poor, until the day when, by a natural and inevitable process, discontent and disappointment were converted into penitence and remorse\". \nHowever, more recent historians defend George by saying in the context of the times no king would willingly surrender such a large territory, and his conduct was far less ruthless than contemporary monarchs in Europe. \nAfter Saratoga, both Parliament and the British people were in favour of the war; recruitment ran at high levels and although political opponents were vocal, they remained a small minority. \nWith the setbacks in America, Prime Minister Lord North asked to transfer power to Lord Chatham, whom he thought more capable, but George refused to do so; he suggested instead that Chatham serve as a subordinate minister in Lord North's administration, but Chatham refused to co-operate. \nHe died later in the same year.

      "\n\nGeorge insisted on a new law that essentially forbade members of the Royal Family from legally marrying without the consent of the Sovereign. \nThe subsequent bill was unpopular in Parliament, including among George's own ministers, but passed as the Royal Marriages Act 1772. \nShortly afterward, another of George's brothers, Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, revealed he had been secretly married to Maria, Countess Waldegrave, the illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole. \nThe news confirmed George's opinion that he had been right to introduce the law: Maria was related to his political opponents. \nNeither lady was ever received at court.Lord North's government was chiefly concerned with discontent in America. \nTo assuage American opinion most of the custom duties were withdrawn, except for the tea duty, which in George's words was \"one tax to keep up the right [to levy taxes]\". \nIn 1773, the tea ships moored in Boston Harbor were boarded by colonists and the tea thrown overboard, an event that became known as the Boston Tea Party. \nIn Britain, opinion hardened against the colonists, with Chatham now agreeing with North that the destruction of the tea was \"certainly criminal\". ",
      "\n\nIn February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising the Prince of Wales to act as regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons, but before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George III recovered. \nGeorge III hoped that \"the tongue of malice may not paint my intentions in those colours she admires, nor the sycophant extoll me beyond what I deserve\", but in the popular mind George III has been both demonised and praised. \nWhile very popular at the start of his reign, by the mid-1770s George had lost the loyalty of revolutionary American colonists, though it has been estimated that as many as half of the colonists remained loyal. \nThe grievances in the United States Declaration of Independence were presented as \"repeated injuries and usurpations\" that he had committed to establish an \"absolute Tyranny\" over the colonies. \nThe Declaration's wording has contributed to the American public's perception of George as a tyrant. \nContemporary accounts of George III's life fall into two camps: one demonstrating \"attitudes dominant in the latter part of the reign, when the King had become a revered symbol of national resistance to French ideas and French power\", while the other \"derived their views of the King from the bitter partisan strife of the first two decades of the reign, and they expressed in their works the views of the opposition\".",
      "\n\nWith the clear support of Parliament, Lord North introduced measures, which were called the Intolerable Acts by the colonists: the Port of Boston was shut down and the charter of Massachusetts was altered so that the upper house of the legislature was appointed by the Crown instead of elected by the lower house. \nUp to this point, in the words of Professor Peter Thomas, George's \"hopes were centred on a political solution, and he always bowed to his cabinet's opinions even when sceptical of their success. \nThe detailed evidence of the years from 1763 to 1775 tends to exonerate George III from any real responsibility for the American Revolution.\" \nThough the Americans characterised George as a tyrant, in these years he acted as a constitutional monarch supporting the initiatives of his ministers. \nGeorge, in his accession speech to Parliament, proclaimed: \"Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of Britain.\" \nHe inserted this phrase into the speech, written by Lord Hardwicke, to demonstrate his desire to distance himself from his German forebears, who were perceived as caring more for Hanover than for Britain.Although his accession was at first welcomed by politicians of all parties, the first years of his reign were marked by political instability, largely generated as a result of disagreements over the Seven Years' War. \nGeorge was also perceived as favouring Tory ministers, which led to his denunciation by the Whigs as an autocrat.

Later reports suggest the loss was actually more than double that figure, a reduction of nearly 50% of its endowment in the first four months alone. Forbes in March 2009 estimated the loss to be in the range of $12 billion. One of the most visible results of Harvard's attempt to re-balance its budget was their halting of construction of the $1.2 billion Allston Science Complex that had been scheduled to be completed by 2011, resulting in protests from local residents.

      "\n\nOperation Ramadan: By the middle of 1982, Iraq was mostly expelled from Iranian territory, having lost nearly all the gains they made during the invasion in 1980. \nSaddam Hussein used the Israeli invasion of Lebanon as an excuse to seek an end to the war and send the Palestinians aid. \nSeyyed Ruhollah Khomeini rejected peace offers from Baghdad and began preparing to expand into Iraq.Initially, some in Tehran rejected the idea of invasion, claiming that such a move would undermine Iran's moral standing and diminish the sympathy gained by Muslim countries as the result of Saddam's invasion. \nThese individuals were backed by Iranian army officers. \nHowever, these voices were shut out by pro-war voices in Tehran, who claimed that Baghdad could be defeated with the use of zealous fighters and invoking anti-government sentiment amongst Iraq's Shia. \nAt the time, the Iranian population experienced a euphoria of victory. \nThus, plans for invasion included both the silencing of Iraqi artillery that was shelling civilian border towns, destroying the Iraqi Third Corps, and the seizure of Basra (Iraq's third largest city). \nIran's Iraq had concentrated three armoured divisions, the 3rd, 9th, and 10th, as a counter-attack force to attack any penetrations. \nThey were successful in defeating the Iranian breakthroughs, but suffered heavy losses.

Recent scholarship has yielded a more comprehensive view of Mary Shelley's achievements. Scholars have shown increasing interest in her literary output, particularly in her novels, which include the historical novels Valperga (1823) and Perkin Warbeck (1830), the apocalyptic novel The Last Man (1826), and her final two novels, Lodore (1835) and Falkner (1837). Studies of her lesser-known works, such as the travel book Rambles in Germany and Italy (1844) and the biographical articles for Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia (1829‚Äì1846), support the growing view that Mary Shelley remained a political radical throughout her life. Mary Shelley's works often argue that cooperation and sympathy, particularly as practised by women in the family, were the ways to reform civil society. This view was a direct challenge to the individualistic Romantic ethos promoted by Percy Shelley and the Enlightenment political theories articulated by her father, William Godwin.",

On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due.

      "\n\nYellowstone fires of 1988: Before the middle of the 20th century, most forest managers believed that fires should be suppressed at all times. \nBy 1935, the U.S. \nForest Service's fire management policy stipulated that all wildfires were to be suppressed by 10 a.m. the morning after they were first spotted. \nFirefighting crews were established throughout public lands, and generally staffed by young men during fire seasons. \nBy 1940, firefighters known as smokejumpers would parachute out of airplanes to extinguish flames in remote locations. \nBy the beginning of World War II, more than 8,000 fire lookout towers had been constructed in the United States. \nThough many have been torn down due to increased use of airplanes for fire spotting, three are still used each year in Yellowstone. \nFirefighting efforts were highly successful, with the area burned by wildfires reduced from an annual average of 30,000,000 acres (120,000 km2) during the 1930s, to between 2,000,000 acres (8,100 km2) and 5,000,000 acres (20,000 km2) by the 1960s. \nThe need for lumber during World War II was high and fires that destroyed timberland were deemed unacceptable. \nIn 1944, the U.S. \nForest Service developed an ad campaign to help educate the public that all fires were detrimental, using a cartoon black bear named Smokey Bear. \nThis iconic firefighting bear can still be seen on posters with the catchphrase \"Only you can prevent forest fires\". ",
      "\n\nEarly posters of Smokey Bear misled the public into believing that western wildfires were predominantly human-caused. \nIn Yellowstone, human-caused fires average between 6 and 10 annually, while 35 wildfires are ignited by lightning.Some researchers, as well as some timber companies and private citizens, understood that fire was a natural state of affairs in many ecosystems. \nFire would help clean out the understory and dead plant matter, allowing economically important tree species to grow with less competition for nutrients. \nNative Americans would often burn woodlands to reduce overgrowth and increase grasslands for large prey animals such as bison and elk. \nAs early as 1924, environmentalist Aldo Leopold argued that wildfires were beneficial to ecosystems, and were necessary for the natural propagation of numerous tree and plant species. \nOver the next 40 years, increasing numbers of foresters and ecologists concurred about the benefits of wildfire to ecosystems. \nIn 1963, a group of ecologists consulted by the National Park Service released a report recommending that wildfires should be allowed to periodically burn to restore the environmental balance in parks. \nThe Wilderness Act of 1964 helped to address the role of fire as a natural part of ecosystems. \nBy 1968, the National Park Service had adjusted its fire management policies to reflect changing attitudes. \nThe service determined that fires that started naturally (by lightning) would be permitted to burn if they posed little risk to human life and property.

      "\n\nEarly posters of Smokey Bear misled the public into believing that western wildfires were predominantly human-caused. \nIn Yellowstone, human-caused fires average between 6 and 10 annually, while 35 wildfires are ignited by lightning.Some researchers, as well as some timber companies and private citizens, understood that fire was a natural state of affairs in many ecosystems. \nFire would help clean out the understory and dead plant matter, allowing economically important tree species to grow with less competition for nutrients. \nNative Americans would often burn woodlands to reduce overgrowth and increase grasslands for large prey animals such as bison and elk. \nAs early as 1924, environmentalist Aldo Leopold argued that wildfires were beneficial to ecosystems, and were necessary for the natural propagation of numerous tree and plant species. \nOver the next 40 years, increasing numbers of foresters and ecologists concurred about the benefits of wildfire to ecosystems. \nIn 1963, a group of ecologists consulted by the National Park Service released a report recommending that wildfires should be allowed to periodically burn to restore the environmental balance in parks. \nThe Wilderness Act of 1964 helped to address the role of fire as a natural part of ecosystems. \nBy 1968, the National Park Service had adjusted its fire management policies to reflect changing attitudes. \nThe service determined that fires that started naturally (by lightning) would be permitted to burn if they posed little risk to human life and property.

      "\n\nNovell: From 2003 through 2005 Novell released many products across its portfolio, with the intention of arresting falling market share and to move away from dependencies on other Novell products, but the launches were not as successful as Novell had hoped. In late 2004, Chris Stone again left the company, after an apparent control issue with then CEO Jack Messman. In an effort to cut costs, Novell announced a round of layoffs in late 2005. While revenue from its Linux business continued to grow, the growth was not fast enough to offset the decrease in revenue of NetWare. While the company's revenue was not falling rapidly, it wasn't growing, either. Lack of clear direction or effective management meant that Novell took longer than expected to complete its restructuring. Novell based its network protocol on Xerox Network Systems (XNS), and created its own standards from IDP and SPP, which it named Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) and Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX). File and print services ran on the NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) over IPX, as did Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Service Advertising Protocol (SAP).",

      "\n\nAn incense stick clock was an incense stick with calibrations; most were elaborate, sometimes having threads, with weights attached, at even intervals. \nThe weights would drop onto a platter or gong below, signifying that a certain amount of time had elapsed. \nSome incense clocks were held in elegant trays; open-bottomed trays were also used, to allow the weights to be used together with the decorative tray. \nSticks of incense with different scents were also used, so that the hours were marked by a change in fragrance. \nThe incense sticks could be straight or spiraled; the spiraled ones were longer, and were therefore intended for long periods of use, and often hung from the roofs of homes and temples. \nIn Japan, a geisha was paid for the number of senkodokei (incense sticks) that had been consumed while she was present, a practice which continued until 1924.\nIncense seal clocks were used for similar occasions and events as the stick clock; while religious purposes were of primary importance, these clocks were also popular at social gatherings, and were used by Chinese scholars and intellectuals. \nThe seal was a wooden or stone disk with one or more grooves etched in it into which incense was placed. \nThese clocks were common in China, but were produced in fewer numbers in Japan. \nTo signal the passage of a specific amount of time, small pieces of fragrant woods, resins, or different scented incenses could be placed on the incense powder trails. ",
      "\n\nDifferent powdered incense clocks used different formulations of incense, depending on how the clock was laid out. \nThe length of the trail of incense, directly related to the size of the seal, was the primary factor in determining how long the clock would last; all burned for long periods of time, ranging between 12 hours and a month.While early incense seals were made of wood or stone, the Chinese gradually introduced disks made of metal, most likely beginning during the Song dynasty. \nThis allowed craftsmen to more easily create both large and small seals, as well as design and decorate them more aesthetically. \nAnother advantage was the ability to vary the paths of the grooves, to allow for the changing length of the days in the year. \nAs smaller seals became more readily available, the clocks grew in popularity among the Chinese, and were often given as gifts. \nIncense seal clocks are often sought by modern-day clock collectors; however, few remain that have not already been purchased or been placed on display at museums or temples. \nOther ancient timekeeping devices include the candle clock, used in ancient China, ancient Japan, England and Mesopotamia; the timestick, widely used in India and Tibet, as well as some parts of Europe; and the hourglass, which functioned similarly to a water clock.  \nThe sundial, another early clock, relies on shadows to provide a good estimate of the hour on a sunny day.

      "\n\nOrgan transplantation in China: In March 2006, the Ministry of Health issued the Interim Provisions on Clinical Application and Management of Human Organ Transplantation, which stipulated that medical centres must meet new requirements for transplant services; the provinces were made responsible for plans for clinical applications. \nEstablishments performing transplantation were thereby obliged to incorporate considerations for ethics, medical and surgical expertise, and intensive care. \nIn April 2006, the Committee of Clinical Application of Human Organ Transplantation Technologies was created to standardise clinical practice; a national summit on clinical management took place in November 2006 which issued a declaration outlining regulatory steps. \nProfessor Guo Shuzhong conducted a series of face transplant experiments in Xijing hospital, leading in April 2006 to the world's first face transplant that included bone. \nThe donor had been declared brain-dead before the operation.In May 2007 the Regulation on Human Organ Transplantation came into force, banning organ trading and the removal of a person's organs without their prior written consent, and this has been favourably received by the World Health Organization and The Transplantation Society. \nTo curb illegal transplants, doctors involved in commercial trade of organs will face fines and suspensions; only a few hospitals will be certified to perform organ transplants.

He also divided the districts of Rome among the deacons. During his pontificate, anti-Christian measures increased, although new churches were built and cemeteries were expanded.

Damit entstand die erste einheitliche chinesische Nation ‚Äì ein entscheidender Schritt zur sp√§teren Entwicklung des chinesischen Staates.\n\n2. **Einheit der Schreibweise**  \n   Er legte eine einheitliche Schreibweise f√ºr chinesische Sprache fest, um die Kommunikation innerhalb des riesigen Reiches zu vereinfachen und die Verwaltung zu erleichtern.\n\n3. **Standardisierung von Ma√ü und Gewicht**  \n   Er setzte einheitliche Ma√üe f√ºr L√§nge, Gewicht und Fl√§chen (z.‚ÄØB. f√ºr Waren, Bauarbeiten und Steuern) um, was die wirtschaftliche und administrative Effizienz verbesserte.\n\n4. **Bau der Great Wall**  \n   Er ordnete den Bau der Gro√üen Mauer in mehreren Abschnitten, um die Grenzen des Reiches gegen invasiven Feinden (insbesondere aus dem Norden, z.‚ÄØB. aus der Mongolei) zu sch√ºtzen. Dieser Bau war Teil eines umfassenden Verteidigungsprogramms.\n\n5. **Einheit der W√§hrung und der Stra√üen**  \n   Er standardisierte die W√§hrung und baute eine umfassende Stra√üennetz, das den Transport von Waren, Soldaten und Nachrichten erleichterte.\n\n6. **Zentralisierte Verwaltung**  \n   Er gr√ºndete eine zentrale, zentralisierte Regierung mit einer klaren Hierarchie ‚Äì vom Kaiser bis hin zu den Beamten ‚Äì und stellte die Macht des Kaisers √ºber die gesamte Verwaltung sicher.\n\n7. **Bau von Zentral- und Stadtkomplexen**  \n   Er baute gro√üe St√§dte und administrative Zentren, darunter die Stadt Xian (heute Xi‚Äôan), die zu einem zentralen politischen und kulturellen Kern wurde.\n\n8. **Kulturbewusstsein und Immortalit√§t**  \n   Qin Shi Huang hatte eine gro√üe Sehnsucht nach Immortalit√§t, was durch seine zahlreichen Expeditionen nach der ‚ÄûImmortalit√§t‚Äú (z.‚ÄØB. nach den ‚ÄûImmortalen Inseln‚Äú) und die Suche nach Zauberei und Arzneimitteln gezeigt wurde.

      "\n\nWith the clear support of Parliament, Lord North introduced measures, which were called the Intolerable Acts by the colonists: the Port of Boston was shut down and the charter of Massachusetts was altered so that the upper house of the legislature was appointed by the Crown instead of elected by the lower house. \nUp to this point, in the words of Professor Peter Thomas, George's \"hopes were centred on a political solution, and he always bowed to his cabinet's opinions even when sceptical of their success. \nThe detailed evidence of the years from 1763 to 1775 tends to exonerate George III from any real responsibility for the American Revolution.\" \nThough the Americans characterised George as a tyrant, in these years he acted as a constitutional monarch supporting the initiatives of his ministers. \nGeorge, in his accession speech to Parliament, proclaimed: \"Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of Britain.\" \nHe inserted this phrase into the speech, written by Lord Hardwicke, to demonstrate his desire to distance himself from his German forebears, who were perceived as caring more for Hanover than for Britain.Although his accession was at first welcomed by politicians of all parties, the first years of his reign were marked by political instability, largely generated as a result of disagreements over the Seven Years' War. \nGeorge was also perceived as favouring Tory ministers, which led to his denunciation by the Whigs as an autocrat.

      "\n\nGeorge insisted on a new law that essentially forbade members of the Royal Family from legally marrying without the consent of the Sovereign. \nThe subsequent bill was unpopular in Parliament, including among George's own ministers, but passed as the Royal Marriages Act 1772. \nShortly afterward, another of George's brothers, Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, revealed he had been secretly married to Maria, Countess Waldegrave, the illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole. \nThe news confirmed George's opinion that he had been right to introduce the law: Maria was related to his political opponents. \nNeither lady was ever received at court.Lord North's government was chiefly concerned with discontent in America. \nTo assuage American opinion most of the custom duties were withdrawn, except for the tea duty, which in George's words was \"one tax to keep up the right [to levy taxes]\". \nIn 1773, the tea ships moored in Boston Harbor were boarded by colonists and the tea thrown overboard, an event that became known as the Boston Tea Party. \nIn Britain, opinion hardened against the colonists, with Chatham now agreeing with North that the destruction of the tea was \"certainly criminal\".

      "\n\nHistory of chemistry: Around 420 BC, Empedocles stated that all matter is made up of four elemental substances: earth, fire, air and water. The early theory of atomism can be traced back to ancient Greece and ancient India. Greek atomism dates back to the Greek philosopher Democritus, who declared that matter is composed of indivisible and indestructible particles called \"atomos\" around 380 BC. Leucippus also declared that atoms were the most indivisible part of matter. This coincided with a similar declaration by Indian philosopher Kanada in his Vaisheshika sutras around the same time period. In much the same fashion he discussed the existence of gases. What Kanada declared by sutra, Democritus declared by philosophical musing. Both suffered from a lack of empirical data. Without scientific proof, the existence of atoms was easy to deny. Aristotle opposed the existence of atoms in 330 BC. Earlier, in 380 BC, a Greek text attributed to Polybus argued that the human body is composed of four humours. Around 300 BC, Epicurus postulated a universe of indestructible atoms in which man himself is responsible for achieving a balanced life.",

      "\n\nNTSC: The National Television System Committee was established in 1940 by the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to resolve the conflicts between companies over the introduction of a nationwide analog television system in the United States. \nIn March 1941, the committee issued a technical standard for black-and-white television that built upon a 1936 recommendation made by the Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA). \nTechnical advancements of the vestigial side band technique allowed for the opportunity to increase the image resolution. \nThe NTSC selected 525 scan lines as a compromise between RCA's 441-scan line standard (already being used by RCA's NBC TV network) and Philco's and DuMont's desire to increase the number of scan lines to between 605 and 800. \nThe standard recommended a frame rate of 30 frames (images) per second, consisting of two interlaced fields per frame at 262.5 lines per field and 60 fields per second. \nOther standards in the final recommendation were an aspect ratio of 4:3, and frequency modulation (FM) for the sound signal (which was quite new at the time). \nThe actual figure of 525 lines was chosen as a consequence of the limitations of the vacuum-tube-based technologies of the day. \nIn early TV systems, a master voltage-controlled oscillator was run at twice the horizontal line frequency, and this frequency was divided down by the number of lines used (in this case 525) to give the field frequency (60 Hz in this case).

Wenn der Wert des Geldes im Allgemeinen sinkt, wird der Wert der M√ºnzen oft automatisch reduziert.\n\n3. **Kosten der Herstellung**: Wenn die Herstellung von M√ºnzen (z.‚ÄØB. aus Gold oder Silber) teuer ist, kann die Regierung entscheiden, die M√ºnzen zu \"verwerten\" oder zu \"verd√ºnnen\", um die Kosten zu senken.\n\n4. **Politische oder soziale Gr√ºnde**: In manchen F√§llen kann die Abwertung von M√ºnzen auch ein Signal f√ºr Wirtschaftsprobleme sein, z.‚ÄØB. bei einer W√§hrungskrise.\n\nAber Achtung: In der realen Welt ist die Abwertung von M√ºnzen oft nicht einfach oder direkt m√∂glich.

      "\n\nIsaac Newton: From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During this period he investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum produced by a prism could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.He showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour. From 1978 until 1988, an image of Newton designed by Harry Ecclestone appeared on Series D ¬£1 banknotes issued by the Bank of England (the last ¬£1 notes to be issued by the Bank of England).

      "\n\nAnother Egyptian method of determining the time during the night was using plumb-lines called merkhets. \nIn use since at least 600 BC, two of these instruments were aligned with Polaris, the north pole star, to create a north‚Äìsouth meridian. \nThe time was accurately measured by observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the merkhets. \nIn Greek tradition, clepsydrae were used in court; later, the Romans adopted this practice, as well. \nThere are several mentions of this in historical records and literature of the era; for example, in Theaetetus, Plato says that \"Those men, on the other hand, always speak in haste, for the flowing water urges them on\". \nAnother mention occurs in Lucius Apuleius' The Golden Ass: \"The Clerk of the Court began bawling again, this time summoning the chief witness for the prosecution to appear. \nUp stepped an old man, whom I did not know. \nHe was invited to speak for as long as there was water in the clock; this was a hollow globe into which water was poured through a funnel in the neck, and from which it gradually escaped through fine perforations at the base\". \nThe clock in Apuleius's account was one of several types of water clock used. \nAnother consisted of a bowl with a hole in its centre, which was floated on water.

While the company's revenue was not falling rapidly, it wasn't growing, either.

The Milky Way Galaxy, where our own Solar System is located, is classified as a barred spiral galaxy.Edwin Hubble classified spiral galaxies of this type as \"SB\" (spiral, barred) in his Hubble sequence and arranged them into sub-categories based on how open the arms of the spiral are. SBa types feature tightly bound arms, while SBc types are at the other extreme and have loosely bound arms. SBb-type galaxies lie in between the two. SB0 is a barred lenticular galaxy. A new type, SBm, was subsequently created to describe somewhat irregular barred spirals, such as the Magellanic Clouds, which were once classified as irregular galaxies, but have since been found to contain barred spiral structures.

It first flew on 9 May 1997 and was delivered new to Middle East Airlines on 27 May 1997 with registration of F-OHMP. In 2003, it was leased by Onur Air and, beginning in 2007, it was subleased to Saudi Arabian Airlines and other carriers. In April 2012, Kolavia acquired the aircraft with a new registration of EI-ETJ and transferred it to Kogalymavia in May.At the time of the crash, the aircraft was owned by Dublin-based AerCap and leased to Kolavia. The aircraft had accumulated 56,000 flight hours on nearly 21,000 flights.On 16 November 2001, while operating for Middle East Airlines as F-OHMP, the aircraft suffered a tailstrike while landing in Cairo. It was repaired and returned to service with the airline in 2002.",

      "\n\nEuclidean vector: v. This important requirement is what distinguishes a contravariant vector from any other triple of physically meaningful quantities. For example, if v consists of the x, y, and z-components of velocity, then v is a contravariant vector: if the coordinates of space are stretched, rotated, or twisted, then the components of the velocity transform in the same way. On the other hand, for instance, a triple consisting of the length, width, and height of a rectangular box could make up the three components of an abstract vector, but this vector would not be contravariant, since rotating the box does not change the box's length, width, and height. Examples of contravariant vectors include displacement, velocity, electric field, momentum, force, and acceleration.",

      "\n\nAdobe Photoshop: Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS. It was originally created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, this software has become the industry standard not only in raster graphics editing, but in digital art as a whole. The software's name has thus become a generic trademark, leading to its usage as a verb (e.g. \"to photoshop an image\", \"photoshopping\", and \"photoshop contest\") although Adobe discourages such use. Photoshop can edit and compose raster images in multiple layers and supports masks, alpha compositing, and several color models including RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, spot color, and duotone. Photoshop uses its own PSD and PSB file formats to support these features. In addition to raster graphics, this software has limited abilities to edit or render text and vector graphics (especially through clipping path for the latter), as well as 3D graphics and video. Its feature set can be expanded by plug-ins; programs developed and distributed independently of Photoshop that run inside it and offer new or enhanced features.",
      "\n\nHistory of chemistry: Around 420 BC, Empedocles stated that all matter is made up of four elemental substances: earth, fire, air and water. The early theory of atomism can be traced back to ancient Greece and ancient India. Greek atomism dates back to the Greek philosopher Democritus, who declared that matter is composed of indivisible and indestructible particles called \"atomos\" around 380 BC. Leucippus also declared that atoms were the most indivisible part of matter. This coincided with a similar declaration by Indian philosopher Kanada in his Vaisheshika sutras around the same time period. In much the same fashion he discussed the existence of gases. What Kanada declared by sutra, Democritus declared by philosophical musing. Both suffered from a lack of empirical data. Without scientific proof, the existence of atoms was easy to deny. Aristotle opposed the existence of atoms in 330 BC. Earlier, in 380 BC, a Greek text attributed to Polybus argued that the human body is composed of four humours. Around 300 BC, Epicurus postulated a universe of indestructible atoms in which man himself is responsible for achieving a balanced life."

      "\n\nRNA: Like DNA, RNA can carry genetic information. RNA viruses have genomes composed of RNA that encodes a number of proteins. The viral genome is replicated by some of those proteins, while other proteins protect the genome as the virus particle moves to a new host cell. Viroids are another group of pathogens, but they consist only of RNA, do not encode any protein and are replicated by a host plant cell's polymerase. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the RNA that carries information from DNA to the ribosome, the sites of protein synthesis (translation) in the cell. The coding sequence of the mRNA determines the amino acid sequence in the protein that is produced. However, many RNAs do not code for protein (about 97% of the transcriptional output is non-protein-coding in eukaryotes)."

      "\n\nPegasus Airlines: On 1 December 1989 two businesses, Net and Silkar, partnered with Aer Lingus to create an inclusive tour charter airline called Pegasus Airlines and services were inaugurated on 15 April 1990 with two Boeing 737‚Äì400s. \nIn Greek mythology, Pegasus (Greek: Œ†ŒÆŒ≥Œ±œÉŒøœÇ, P√©gasos, 'strong') was a winged horse sired by Poseidon, in his role as horse-god, and foaled by the Gorgon Medusa. \nHowever, four months after the launch, Iraq invaded Kuwait and the seven month occupation that followed had a serious effect on Turkish tourism. \nBy 1992, tourists began returning to the country and Pegasus grew with the acquisition of a third 737-400. \nThe airline leased a further two Airbus A320s to meet the summer demand.After two positive years, Aer Lingus and Net sold their shares in the company in 1994 to Istanbul-based Yapi Kredibank, making Pegasus a purely Turkish company.On 4 September 1997, Pegasus placed an order for one 737-400 and one 737‚Äì800 from Boeing Commercial Airplanes making it the first Turkish carrier to place an order for the Boeing 737 Next Generation. \nThe airline also signed lease agreements for a further 10 737-800s from the ILFC.In January 2005, ESAS Holdings purchased Pegasus Airlines and placed Ali Sabanci as the chairman. \nTwo months later, he changed the airline from a charter airline, to a low-cost airline.

      "\n\nDian Fossey: Although Fossey had always been an exemplary student, she had difficulties with basic sciences including chemistry and physics, and failed her second year of the program. She transferred to San Jose State College, where she became a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, to study occupational therapy, receiving her bachelor's degree in 1954. Initially following her college major, Fossey began a career in occupational therapy. She interned at various hospitals in California and worked with tuberculosis patients. Fossey was originally a prizewinning equestrian, which drew her to Kentucky in 1955, and a year later took a job as an occupational therapist at the Kosair Crippled Children's Hospital in Louisville.Her shy and reserved personality allowed her to work well with the children at the hospital. Fossey became close with her coworker Mary White \"Gaynee\" Henry, secretary to the hospital's chief administrator and the wife of one of the doctors, Michael J. Henry. The Henrys invited Fossey to join them on their family farm, where she worked with livestock on a daily basis and also experienced an inclusive family atmosphere that had been missing for most of her life. During her free time she would pursue her love of horses."
