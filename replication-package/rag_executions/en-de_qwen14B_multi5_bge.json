      "\n\nNTSC: The National Television System Committee was established in 1940 by the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to resolve the conflicts between companies over the introduction of a nationwide analog television system in the United States. \nIn March 1941, the committee issued a technical standard for black-and-white television that built upon a 1936 recommendation made by the Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA). \nTechnical advancements of the vestigial side band technique allowed for the opportunity to increase the image resolution. \nThe NTSC selected 525 scan lines as a compromise between RCA's 441-scan line standard (already being used by RCA's NBC TV network) and Philco's and DuMont's desire to increase the number of scan lines to between 605 and 800. \nThe standard recommended a frame rate of 30 frames (images) per second, consisting of two interlaced fields per frame at 262.5 lines per field and 60 fields per second. \nOther standards in the final recommendation were an aspect ratio of 4:3, and frequency modulation (FM) for the sound signal (which was quite new at the time). \nThe actual figure of 525 lines was chosen as a consequence of the limitations of the vacuum-tube-based technologies of the day. \nIn early TV systems, a master voltage-controlled oscillator was run at twice the horizontal line frequency, and this frequency was divided down by the number of lines used (in this case 525) to give the field frequency (60 Hz in this case).

      "\n\nThis frequency was then compared with the 60 Hz power-line frequency and any discrepancy corrected by adjusting the frequency of the master oscillator. \nFor interlaced scanning, an odd number of lines per frame was required in order to make the vertical retrace distance identical for the odd and even fields, which meant the master oscillator frequency had to be divided down by an odd number."

      "\n\nHistory of chemistry: Around 420 BC, Empedocles stated that all matter is made up of four elemental substances: earth, fire, air and water. The early theory of atomism can be traced back to ancient Greece and ancient India. Greek atomism dates back to the Greek philosopher Democritus, who declared that matter is composed of indivisible and indestructible particles called \"atomos\" around 380 BC. Leucippus also declared that atoms were the most indivisible part of matter. This coincided with a similar declaration by Indian philosopher Kanada in his Vaisheshika sutras around the same time period. In much the same fashion he discussed the existence of gases. What Kanada declared by sutra, Democritus declared by philosophical musing. Both suffered from a lack of empirical data. Without scientific proof, the existence of atoms was easy to deny. Aristotle opposed the existence of atoms in 330 BC. Earlier, in 380 BC, a Greek text attributed to Polybus argued that the human body is composed of four humours. Around 300 BC, Epicurus postulated a universe of indestructible atoms in which man himself is responsible for achieving a balanced life.",

      "\n\nTernary computer: One early calculating machine, built by Thomas Fowler entirely from wood in 1840, operated in balanced ternary. \nThe first modern, electronic ternary computer Setun was built in 1958 in the Soviet Union at the Moscow State University by Nikolay Brusentsov, and it had notable advantages over the binary computers which eventually replaced it, such as lower electricity consumption and lower production cost. \nIn 1970 Brusentsov built an enhanced version of the computer, which he called Setun-70.  \nIn the USA, the ternary computing emulator Ternac working on a binary machine was developed in 1973.\nThe ternary computer QTC-1 was developed in Canada. \nWith the advent of mass-produced binary components for computers, ternary computers have diminished in significance. \nHowever, Donald Knuth argues that they will be brought back into development in the future to take advantage of ternary logic's elegance and efficiency. \nOne possible way this could happen is by combining an optical computer with the ternary logic system. \nA ternary computer using fiber optics could use dark as 0 and two orthogonal polarizations of light as 1 and ‚àí1. \nIBM also reports infrequently on ternary computing topics (in its papers), but it is not actively engaged in it.The Josephson junction has been proposed as a balanced ternary memory cell, using circulating superconducting currents, either clockwise, counterclockwise, or off.

In 1848, Engels co-authored The Communist Manifesto with Marx and also authored and co-authored (primarily with Marx) many other works. Later, Engels supported Marx financially, allowing him to do research and write Das Kapital. After Marx's death, Engels edited the second and third volumes of Das Kapital.

During this period he investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum produced by a prism could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.He showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour. From 1978 until 1988, an image of Newton designed by Harry Ecclestone appeared on Series D ¬£1 banknotes issued by the Bank of England (the last ¬£1 notes to be issued by the Bank of England).

      "\n\nIn February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising the Prince of Wales to act as regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons, but before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George III recovered. \nGeorge III hoped that \"the tongue of malice may not paint my intentions in those colours she admires, nor the sycophant extoll me beyond what I deserve\", but in the popular mind George III has been both demonised and praised. \nWhile very popular at the start of his reign, by the mid-1770s George had lost the loyalty of revolutionary American colonists, though it has been estimated that as many as half of the colonists remained loyal. \nThe grievances in the United States Declaration of Independence were presented as \"repeated injuries and usurpations\" that he had committed to establish an \"absolute Tyranny\" over the colonies. \nThe Declaration's wording has contributed to the American public's perception of George as a tyrant. \nContemporary accounts of George III's life fall into two camps: one demonstrating \"attitudes dominant in the latter part of the reign, when the King had become a revered symbol of national resistance to French ideas and French power\", while the other \"derived their views of the King from the bitter partisan strife of the first two decades of the reign, and they expressed in their works the views of the opposition\".",
      "\n\nWith the clear support of Parliament, Lord North introduced measures, which were called the Intolerable Acts by the colonists: the Port of Boston was shut down and the charter of Massachusetts was altered so that the upper house of the legislature was appointed by the Crown instead of elected by the lower house. \nUp to this point, in the words of Professor Peter Thomas, George's \"hopes were centred on a political solution, and he always bowed to his cabinet's opinions even when sceptical of their success. \nThe detailed evidence of the years from 1763 to 1775 tends to exonerate George III from any real responsibility for the American Revolution.\" \nThough the Americans characterised George as a tyrant, in these years he acted as a constitutional monarch supporting the initiatives of his ministers. \nGeorge, in his accession speech to Parliament, proclaimed: \"Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of Britain.\" \nHe inserted this phrase into the speech, written by Lord Hardwicke, to demonstrate his desire to distance himself from his German forebears, who were perceived as caring more for Hanover than for Britain.Although his accession was at first welcomed by politicians of all parties, the first years of his reign were marked by political instability, largely generated as a result of disagreements over the Seven Years' War. \nGeorge was also perceived as favouring Tory ministers, which led to his denunciation by the Whigs as an autocrat.

      "\n\nAt age 10, George took part in a family production of Joseph Addison's play Cato and said in the new prologue: \"What, tho' a boy! \nIt may with truth be said, A boy in England born, in England bred.\" \nHistorian Romney Sedgwick argued that these lines appear \"to be the source of the only historical phrase with which he is associated\".\nGeorge's grandfather, King George II, disliked the Prince of Wales, and took little interest in his grandchildren. \nHowever, in 1751 the Prince of Wales died unexpectedly from a lung injury at the age of 44, and George became heir apparent to the throne. \nHe inherited his father's title of Duke of Edinburgh. \nNow more interested in his grandson, three weeks later the king created George Prince of Wales (the title is not automatically acquired). \nWith the collapse of Lord North's ministry in 1782, the Whig Lord Rockingham became Prime Minister for the second time, but died within months. \nThe King then appointed Lord Shelburne to replace him. \nCharles James Fox, however, refused to serve under Shelburne, and demanded the appointment of the Duke of Portland. \nIn 1783, the House of Commons forced Shelburne from office and his government was replaced by the Fox‚ÄìNorth Coalition. \nThe Duke of Portland became Prime Minister, with Fox and Lord North, as Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary respectively.",
      "\n\nIn 1765, Grenville introduced the Stamp Act, which levied a stamp duty on every document in the British colonies in North America. \nSince newspapers were printed on stamped paper, those most affected by the introduction of the duty were the most effective at producing propaganda opposing the tax. \nMeanwhile, the King had become exasperated at Grenville's attempts to reduce the King's prerogatives, and tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade William Pitt the Elder to accept the office of Prime Minister. \nAfter a brief illness, which may have presaged his illnesses to come, George settled on Lord Rockingham to form a ministry, and dismissed Grenville. \nMeanwhile, George's health deteriorated. \nHe developed dementia, and became completely blind and increasingly deaf. \nHe was incapable of knowing or understanding that he was declared King of Hanover in 1814, or that his wife died in 1818. \nAt Christmas 1819, he spoke nonsense for 58 hours, and for the last few weeks of his life was unable to walk. \nHe died at Windsor Castle at 8:38 pm on 29 January 1820, six days after the death of his fourth son, the Duke of Kent. \nHis favourite son, Frederick, Duke of York, was with him.

Hier sind die Hauptgr√ºnde:\n\n1. **Extrem niedrige Temperaturen**: Die Antarktis ist das k√§lteste Gebiet der Erde. Regenw√ºrmer sind kaltbl√ºtig und ben√∂tigen Temperaturen, die nahe dem Bodentemperatur liegen (meist zwischen 5 ¬∞C und 25 ¬∞C).

In der Antarktis gibt es kaum Pflanzenwachstum, da die Vegetationsperiode extrem kurz ist und die Bodenbedingungen (z. B. Gletscher, Permafrost) die N√§hrstoffverf√ºgbarkeit stark begrenzen.\n\n3. **Permafrost und gefrorener Boden**: Der Boden in der Antarktis ist √ºberwiegend von Permafrost (st√§ndig gefrorenem Boden) bedeckt. Regenw√ºrmer ben√∂tigen feuchten, lockeren Boden, um sich zu bewegen und zu graben. Ein gefrorener Boden verhindert ihre Bewegung und f√ºhrt zu ihrer Erstickung oder Austrocknung.\n\n4. **Mangel an Feuchtigkeit**: Obwohl die Antarktis viel Schnee hat, ist der Boden oft trocken und nicht in der Lage, genug Feuchtigkeit zu speichern, um die Regenw√ºrmer zu √ºberleben zu lassen. Regenw√ºrmer ben√∂tigen eine konstante Feuchtigkeit, um ihre Haut nicht austrocknen zu lassen.\n\n5. **Keine nat√ºrliche Anpassung**: Es gibt keine einheimischen Regenw√ºrmer in der Antarktis. Selbst eingef√ºhrte Arten h√§tten Schwierigkeiten, sich an die extremen Bedingungen anzupassen, da sie evolution√§r nicht f√ºr solch eine Umgebung ausgebildet sind.\n\nZusammenfassend ist die Antarktis einfach zu kalt, zu trocken und zu unwirtlich, um Regenw√ºrmer zu beherbergen.

She transferred to San Jose State College, where she became a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, to study occupational therapy, receiving her bachelor's degree in 1954. Initially following her college major, Fossey began a career in occupational therapy. She interned at various hospitals in California and worked with tuberculosis patients. Fossey was originally a prizewinning equestrian, which drew her to Kentucky in 1955, and a year later took a job as an occupational therapist at the Kosair Crippled Children's Hospital in Louisville.Her shy and reserved personality allowed her to work well with the children at the hospital. Fossey became close with her coworker Mary White \"Gaynee\" Henry, secretary to the hospital's chief administrator and the wife of one of the doctors, Michael J. Henry. The Henrys invited Fossey to join them on their family farm, where she worked with livestock on a daily basis and also experienced an inclusive family atmosphere that had been missing for most of her life.

Larka became the first Minister of War of Republic of Estonia; in March he achieved rank of Major General. In 1918, during the German occupation, he participated in organising the Defence League. After the start of the Estonian Liberation War in 1918, Larka soon moved from position of Minister of War to Chief of Staff.

After the war he also organized demobilization. He retired in 1925 because of health issues. In 1930 he became official leader of the League of Liberators and was their candidate in the April 1934 presidential elections.

      "\n\nMary Shelley: Until the 1970s, Mary Shelley was known mainly for her efforts to publish her husband's works and for her novel Frankenstein, which remains widely read and has inspired many theatrical and film adaptations. Recent scholarship has yielded a more comprehensive view of Mary Shelley's achievements. Scholars have shown increasing interest in her literary output, particularly in her novels, which include the historical novels Valperga (1823) and Perkin Warbeck (1830), the apocalyptic novel The Last Man (1826), and her final two novels, Lodore (1835) and Falkner (1837). Studies of her lesser-known works, such as the travel book Rambles in Germany and Italy (1844) and the biographical articles for Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia (1829‚Äì1846), support the growing view that Mary Shelley remained a political radical throughout her life. Mary Shelley's works often argue that cooperation and sympathy, particularly as practised by women in the family, were the ways to reform civil society. This view was a direct challenge to the individualistic Romantic ethos promoted by Percy Shelley and the Enlightenment political theories articulated by her father, William Godwin.",

      "\n\nPakistan: Four periods are recognised in Pakistani architecture: pre-Islamic, Islamic, colonial, and post-colonial. With the beginning of the Indus civilization around the middle of the 3rd millennium BCE, an advanced urban culture developed for the first time in the region, with large buildings, some of which survive to this day. Mohenjo Daro, Harappa, and Kot Diji are among the pre-Islamic settlements that are now tourist attractions. The rise of Buddhism and the influence of Greek civilisation led to the development of a Greco-Buddhist style, starting from the 1st century CE. The high point of this era was the Gandhara style. An example of Buddhist architecture is the ruins of the Buddhist monastery Takht-i-Bahi in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa."

    "response": "Die Entflammbarkeit in Baumgruppen kann durch verschiedene Faktoren erh√∂ht werden. Hier sind die wichtigsten:\n\n1. **Art der B√§ume**:  \n   - **Nadelb√§ume** (z. B. Fichten, Tannen) sind oft flammbarer als Laubb√§ume, da ihr Harz und trockenes Laub leicht entz√ºndlich sind.  \n   - **Trockene oder kranke B√§ume** mit abgestorbenem Holz bilden zus√§tzliche Brennstoffe.\n\n2. **Dichte der Baumgruppe**:  \n   - Enge Abst√§nde zwischen B√§umen erm√∂glichen eine schnelle Ausbreitung von Feuer durch W√§rme√ºbertragung und Funkenflug.  \n   - Dichte Kronenstrukturen k√∂nnen das Feuer vertikal (z. B. von der Erde in die Kronen) verst√§rken.\n\n3. **Trockenheit der Vegetation**:  \n   - **Lange Trockenperioden** oder D√ºrren reduzieren den Feuchtigkeitsgehalt von Bl√§ttern, Zweigen und Moos, was die Entz√ºndbarkeit erh√∂ht.  \n   - **Abgestorbene Pflanzenmaterialien** (z. B. totes Laub, √Ñste) wirken als \"Tinder\" und beschleunigen die Ausbreitung.\n\n4. **Wind**:  \n   - Starke Winde tragen Funken √ºber weite Strecken und beschleunigen die Ausbreitung des Feuers.  \n   - Sie k√∂nnen auch das Feuer in neue Bereiche \"verpflanzen\", z. B. in benachbarte Baumgruppen.\n\n5. **Menschliche Einfl√ºsse**:  \n   - **Unachtsame Handlungen** wie offene Feuer, Zigaretten oder Feuerwerksk√∂rper k√∂nnen Br√§nde ausl√∂sen.  \n   - **Abfall oder Brennstoffe** in der N√§he (z. B. Holzhaufen, chemische Mittel) erh√∂hen das Risiko.\n\n6. **Jahreszeit und Wetterbedingungen**:  \n   - **Sommer und Herbst** sind typisch f√ºr trockene Bedingungen und erh√∂hte Brandgefahr.  \n   - **Tiefstehende Nebel oder Hohe Luftfeuchtigkeit** k√∂nnen die Entflammbarkeit d√§mpfen, w√§hrend trockene Luft sie steigert.\n\n7. **Strukturelle Anordnung**:  \n   - **Mehrere Schichten** von Veget",

      "\n\nYellowstone fires of 1988: Before the middle of the 20th century, most forest managers believed that fires should be suppressed at all times. \nBy 1935, the U.S. \nForest Service's fire management policy stipulated that all wildfires were to be suppressed by 10 a.m. the morning after they were first spotted. \nFirefighting crews were established throughout public lands, and generally staffed by young men during fire seasons. \nBy 1940, firefighters known as smokejumpers would parachute out of airplanes to extinguish flames in remote locations. \nBy the beginning of World War II, more than 8,000 fire lookout towers had been constructed in the United States. \nThough many have been torn down due to increased use of airplanes for fire spotting, three are still used each year in Yellowstone. \nFirefighting efforts were highly successful, with the area burned by wildfires reduced from an annual average of 30,000,000 acres (120,000 km2) during the 1930s, to between 2,000,000 acres (8,100 km2) and 5,000,000 acres (20,000 km2) by the 1960s. \nThe need for lumber during World War II was high and fires that destroyed timberland were deemed unacceptable. \nIn 1944, the U.S. \nForest Service developed an ad campaign to help educate the public that all fires were detrimental, using a cartoon black bear named Smokey Bear. \nThis iconic firefighting bear can still be seen on posters with the catchphrase \"Only you can prevent forest fires\".

      "\n\nNovell: From 2003 through 2005 Novell released many products across its portfolio, with the intention of arresting falling market share and to move away from dependencies on other Novell products, but the launches were not as successful as Novell had hoped. In late 2004, Chris Stone again left the company, after an apparent control issue with then CEO Jack Messman. In an effort to cut costs, Novell announced a round of layoffs in late 2005. While revenue from its Linux business continued to grow, the growth was not fast enough to offset the decrease in revenue of NetWare. While the company's revenue was not falling rapidly, it wasn't growing, either. Lack of clear direction or effective management meant that Novell took longer than expected to complete its restructuring. Novell based its network protocol on Xerox Network Systems (XNS), and created its own standards from IDP and SPP, which it named Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) and Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX). File and print services ran on the NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) over IPX, as did Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Service Advertising Protocol (SAP).",

      "\n\nDifferent powdered incense clocks used different formulations of incense, depending on how the clock was laid out. \nThe length of the trail of incense, directly related to the size of the seal, was the primary factor in determining how long the clock would last; all burned for long periods of time, ranging between 12 hours and a month.While early incense seals were made of wood or stone, the Chinese gradually introduced disks made of metal, most likely beginning during the Song dynasty. \nThis allowed craftsmen to more easily create both large and small seals, as well as design and decorate them more aesthetically. \nAnother advantage was the ability to vary the paths of the grooves, to allow for the changing length of the days in the year. \nAs smaller seals became more readily available, the clocks grew in popularity among the Chinese, and were often given as gifts. \nIncense seal clocks are often sought by modern-day clock collectors; however, few remain that have not already been purchased or been placed on display at museums or temples. \nOther ancient timekeeping devices include the candle clock, used in ancient China, ancient Japan, England and Mesopotamia; the timestick, widely used in India and Tibet, as well as some parts of Europe; and the hourglass, which functioned similarly to a water clock.  \nThe sundial, another early clock, relies on shadows to provide a good estimate of the hour on a sunny day.

      "\n\nAfter five years of study, Pope came into contact with figures from the London literary society such as William Wycherley, William Congreve, Samuel Garth, William Trumbull, and William Walsh.At Binfield, he also began to make many important friends. \nOne of them, John Caryll (the future dedicatee of The Rape of the Lock), was twenty years older than the poet and had made many acquaintances in the London literary world. \nHe introduced the young Pope to the aging playwright William Wycherley and to William Walsh, a minor poet, who helped Pope revise his first major work, The Pastorals. \nHe also met the Blount sisters, Teresa and Martha, both of whom would remain lifelong friends.From the age of 12, he suffered numerous health problems including Pott's disease (a form of tuberculosis that affects the spine), which deformed his body and stunted his growth, leaving him with a severe hunchback. \nHis tuberculosis infection caused other health problems including respiratory difficulties, high fevers, inflamed eyes, and abdominal pain.  \nHe grew to a height of only 1.37 m (4 ft 6 in). \nPope was already removed from society because he was Catholic; his poor health only alienated him further. \nAlthough he never married, he had many female friends to whom he wrote witty letters, including Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. \nAllegedly, his lifelong friend Martha Blount was his lover.",
      "\n\nAmalie Schoppe: Her friends included Rosa Maria Assing, Justinus Kerner and Adelbert von Chamisso, along with the young poet Friedrich Hebbel, whom she introduced to patrons and allowed to use her study. From 1827 to 1846 she edited the Pariser Modebl√§tter as well writing literary articles for it. She also wrote for several other magazines and from 1831 to 1839 edited the young peoples' magazine Iduna. From 1842 to 1845 she lived in Jena, before moving back to Hamburg and finally in 1851 to the United States of America with her son, where she died aged 66 in Schenectady, New York"

This coloration is the same in both genders.The song of the American goldfinch is a series of musical warbles and twitters, often with a long note. A tsee-tsi-tsi-tsit call is often given in flight; it may also be described as per-chic-o-ree. While the female incubates the eggs, she calls to her returning mate with a soft continuous teeteeteeteete sound. The young begin to use a call of chick-kee or chick-wee shortly before fledging, which they use until they have left the nest entirely. There are two defense calls made by adults during nesting; a sweet call made to rally other goldfinches to the nest and distract predators, and a bearbee used to signal to the nestlings to quiet them and get them to crouch down in the nest to become less conspicuous.",

B. der ber√ºhmte **Gro√üe Wall**, obwohl dieser erst sp√§ter ausgebaut wurde).\n\n3. **Zentralisierung der Macht**: Er errichtete ein zentrales B√ºrokratie-System mit **Zivilbeamten**, die auf Grundlage von Pr√ºfungen ausgew√§hlt wurden, und stellte die **Kaiserliche Familie** an die Spitze des Staates.\n\n4. **Einf√ºhrung des Titels ‚ÄûKaiser‚Äú (Huangdi)**: Er war der erste, der diesen Titel annahm, um seine √ºberlegene Macht zu symbolisieren.\n\n5. **Bek√§mpfung von Widerstand**: Seine Herrschaft war von strengen Ma√ünahmen gepr√§gt, wie der Verfolgung von Widerstandskr√§ften (z. B. des Ministers L√º Buwei) und der Zerst√∂rung von Traditionen (z. B. der **B√ºcherverbrennung** und der **Unterdr√ºckung von Philosophen**).\n\n**Kritik und Kontroversen**:  \n- Seine Herrschaft wird traditionell als autorit√§r und brutal beschrieben, insbesondere wegen seiner Jagd auf Unsterblichkeit (z. B. durch Zauberer) und der Repression gegen die Bev√∂lkerung.  \n- Nach dem marxistischen Verst√§ndnis (wie im Kontext erw√§hnt) wurde er als **progressiver Herrscher** dargestellt, der die feudalen Strukturen zerst√∂rte, aber gleichzeitig nicht vollst√§ndig die soziale Ungleichheit beseitigte.

      "\n\nHistory of chemistry: Around 420 BC, Empedocles stated that all matter is made up of four elemental substances: earth, fire, air and water. The early theory of atomism can be traced back to ancient Greece and ancient India. Greek atomism dates back to the Greek philosopher Democritus, who declared that matter is composed of indivisible and indestructible particles called \"atomos\" around 380 BC. Leucippus also declared that atoms were the most indivisible part of matter. This coincided with a similar declaration by Indian philosopher Kanada in his Vaisheshika sutras around the same time period. In much the same fashion he discussed the existence of gases. What Kanada declared by sutra, Democritus declared by philosophical musing. Both suffered from a lack of empirical data. Without scientific proof, the existence of atoms was easy to deny. Aristotle opposed the existence of atoms in 330 BC. Earlier, in 380 BC, a Greek text attributed to Polybus argued that the human body is composed of four humours. Around 300 BC, Epicurus postulated a universe of indestructible atoms in which man himself is responsible for achieving a balanced life.",

      "\n\nHurricane John (1994): Clearing Johnston Atoll, John turned to the northwest and began strengthening again as shear decreased. \nOn August 27 local time, John reached a secondary peak strength of 135 miles per hour (210 km/h), and shortly thereafter it crossed the International Date Line at approximately 22¬∞ N and came under the surveillance of the Guam branch of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). \nBy crossing into the western Pacific, John also became a typhoon and was referred to as Typhoon John during its time in the western Pacific. \nImmediately after crossing the Date Line, John again weakened and its forward motion stalled. \nBy September 1, John had weakened to a tropical storm and was nearly motionless just west of the Date Line. \nThere, John lingered for six days while performing a multi-day counterclockwise loop. \nOn September 7, a trough moved into the area and quickly moved John to the northeast. \nJohn crossed the Date Line again on September 8 and reentered the central Pacific.After reentering the central Pacific, John briefly reached a tertiary peak strength of 90 miles per hour (145 km/h), a strong Category 1 hurricane, well to the north of Midway Island. \nHowever, the trough was rapidly pulling apart John's structure, and the cold waters of the northern central Pacific were not conducive to a tropical cyclone. ",
      "\n\nAround 1100 PDT on August 20, John crossed into the central Pacific, the first of three basin crosses John would make.After entering the central Pacific, John left the area monitored by the NHC and was instead monitored by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). \nAs the storm moved slowly westward, Hurricane John continued to strengthen considerably in an increasingly favorable environment well south of the Hawaiian Islands; on August 22, John was designated a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale (the highest classification for hurricanes) and later that day (by Hawaii Standard Time) reached its peak intensity, with 1-minute sustained winds of 175 miles per hour (280 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 929 millibars (27.4 inHg). \nAlso, on August 22 (by Hawaii Standard Time), John made its closest approach to the Hawaiian Islands, 345 miles (500 km) to the south. \nJohn had threatened to turn north and affect the islands days before, but the ridge of high pressure that typically shields the islands from hurricanes kept John on its southerly path. \nNonetheless, heavy rains and wind from the outer bands of John affected the islands.With the Hawaiian Islands behind it, John began a slow turn to the north, taking near-direct aim at Johnston Atoll, a small group of islands populated only by a United States military base.

      "\n\nIsaac Newton: From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During this period he investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum produced by a prism could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.He showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour. From 1978 until 1988, an image of Newton designed by Harry Ecclestone appeared on Series D ¬£1 banknotes issued by the Bank of England (the last ¬£1 notes to be issued by the Bank of England). Newton was shown on the reverse of the notes holding a book and accompanied by a telescope, a prism and a map of the Solar System."

The success of Lee's television dramas throughout Asia established him as a top Hallyu star. Lee starred in his first leading role in film with Gangnam Blues (2015), followed by his first China-produced film Bounty Hunters (2016). Lee was born in Heukseok-dong, Dongjak-gu, Seoul. As a child, Lee had hoped to become a professional football player. He was selected for the youth football class of South Korean manager and former professional player Cha Bum-Kun, but an injury in the 5th grade of elementary school put an end to this aspiration. In his second year of high school, Lee turned to acting.",

[knew] better than to waste a second doubting.\"  \nYears later, that memory would help her overcome her initial doubt over whether she was good enough to apply to Columbia. \nAt Columbia, Johnston recognized she was talented but insecure, and one day asked her to \"promise ... that you'll leave it out of your work, just know that you're good enough and move on.\"  \nShe concluded: \"If I learned one thing it is that self-doubt is one of the most destructive forces. \nIt makes you defensive instead of open, reactive instead of active. \nSelf-doubt is consuming and cruel and my hope today is that we can all collectively agree to ban it ... \nPlease know, from here on out, you are enough and dare I say, more than enough.\"  \nUNH then awarded her the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters.In September 2014, it was announced that Lee and Buck would co-direct a short film featuring the Frozen characters called Frozen Fever. \nIt was released in March 2015.

      "\n\nJennifer Lee (filmmaker): After the loss of her boyfriend at age 20, Lee became closer to her sister Amy. \nAt around 30 years old, she entered Columbia University School of the Arts and earned a Master of Fine Arts in film. \nThere she met Phil Johnston, her future writing partner on Wreck-It Ralph. \nLee graduated from Columbia in 2005 and stayed in New York City, where she developed a background in live-action film, working as assistant director on and producer of the short film in 2004, \"A Thousand Words\".\nIn March 2011, Johnston called Lee to ask her to join him at Disney Animation in Burbank to help him write Wreck-It Ralph. \nWhat was supposed to be a temporary eight-week writing gig eventually turned into a much longer commitment. \nFirst, she was asked to stay on until Ralph was finished. \nShe then became involved with Frozen, initially as screenwriter and later as co-director with Chris Buck. \nWhen Lee was brought on board, she helped transition the film from an action-adventure to \"more musical, with more comedy.\" \nShe worked closely with the songwriters (Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez) in the writing of the script. \nFrozen gave her the opportunity to celebrate \"wild and wonderful\" girls like her childhood self, and her daughter, Agatha. \nIt was also the highest-earning film with a female director in terms of domestic earnings, until surpassed by Warner Bros.' \nWonder Woman.On May 17, 2014, Lee delivered the commencement address to the class of 2014 at her alma mater, the University of New Hampshire.

The Milky Way Galaxy, where our own Solar System is located, is classified as a barred spiral galaxy.Edwin Hubble classified spiral galaxies of this type as \"SB\" (spiral, barred) in his Hubble sequence and arranged them into sub-categories based on how open the arms of the spiral are. SBa types feature tightly bound arms, while SBc types are at the other extreme and have loosely bound arms. SBb-type galaxies lie in between the two. SB0 is a barred lenticular galaxy. A new type, SBm, was subsequently created to describe somewhat irregular barred spirals, such as the Magellanic Clouds, which were once classified as irregular galaxies, but have since been found to contain barred spiral structures.

      "\n\nGeorge III of the United Kingdom: A brief lull in hostilities allowed Pitt to concentrate effort on Ireland, where there had been an uprising and attempted French landing in 1798. \nIn 1800, the British and Irish Parliaments passed an Act of Union that took effect on 1 January 1801 and united Great Britain and Ireland into a single state, known as the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\". \nGeorge used the opportunity to abandon the title \"king of France\", which English and British Sovereigns had maintained since the reign of Edward III. \nIt was suggested that George adopt the title \"Emperor of the British Isles\", but he refused. \nAs part of his Irish policy, Pitt planned to remove certain legal disabilities that applied to Roman Catholics. \nGeorge III claimed that to emancipate Catholics would be to violate his coronation oath, in which Sovereigns promise to maintain Protestantism. \nFaced with opposition to his religious reform policies from both the King and the British public, Pitt threatened to resign. \nAt about the same time, the King had a relapse of his previous illness, which he blamed on worry over the Catholic question. \nOn 14 March 1801, Pitt was formally replaced by the Speaker of the House of Commons, Henry Addington. \nAddington opposed emancipation, instituted annual accounts, abolished income tax and began a programme of disarmament. \nIn October 1801, he made peace with the French, and in 1802 signed the Treaty of Amiens.George did not consider the peace with France as real; in his view it was an \"experiment\".

      "\n\nOrgan transplantation in China has taken place since the 1960s, and is one of the largest organ transplant programmes in the world, peaking at over 13,000 transplants a year in 2004. \nChina is also involved in innovative transplant surgery such as face transplantation including bone.Involuntary organ harvesting is illegal under Chinese law; though, under a 1984 regulation, it became legal to remove organs from executed criminals with the prior consent of the criminal or permission of relatives. \nGrowing concerns about possible ethical abuses arising from coerced consent and corruption led medical groups and human rights organizations, by the 1990s, to start condemning the practice. \nThese concerns resurfaced in 2001, when a Chinese asylum-seeking doctor testified that he had taken part in organ extraction operations.In 2006, allegations emerged that a large number of Falun Gong practitioners had been killed to supply China's organ transplant industry. \nAn initial investigation stated \"the source of 41,500 transplants for the six year period 2000 to 2005 is unexplained\" and concluded that \"there has been and continues today to be large scale organ seizures from unwilling Falun Gong practitioners\".\nIn December 2005, China's Deputy Health Minister acknowledged that the practice of removing organs from executed prisoners for transplants was widespread.

For example, if v consists of the x, y, and z-components of velocity, then v is a contravariant vector: if the coordinates of space are stretched, rotated, or twisted, then the components of the velocity transform in the same way. On the other hand, for instance, a triple consisting of the length, width, and height of a rectangular box could make up the three components of an abstract vector, but this vector would not be contravariant, since rotating the box does not change the box's length, width, and height.

      "\n\nAdobe Photoshop: Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS. It was originally created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, this software has become the industry standard not only in raster graphics editing, but in digital art as a whole. The software's name has thus become a generic trademark, leading to its usage as a verb (e.g. \"to photoshop an image\", \"photoshopping\", and \"photoshop contest\") although Adobe discourages such use. Photoshop can edit and compose raster images in multiple layers and supports masks, alpha compositing, and several color models including RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, spot color, and duotone. Photoshop uses its own PSD and PSB file formats to support these features. In addition to raster graphics, this software has limited abilities to edit or render text and vector graphics (especially through clipping path for the latter), as well as 3D graphics and video. Its feature set can be expanded by plug-ins; programs developed and distributed independently of Photoshop that run inside it and offer new or enhanced features.",
      "\n\nHistory of chemistry: Around 420 BC, Empedocles stated that all matter is made up of four elemental substances: earth, fire, air and water. The early theory of atomism can be traced back to ancient Greece and ancient India. Greek atomism dates back to the Greek philosopher Democritus, who declared that matter is composed of indivisible and indestructible particles called \"atomos\" around 380 BC. Leucippus also declared that atoms were the most indivisible part of matter. This coincided with a similar declaration by Indian philosopher Kanada in his Vaisheshika sutras around the same time period. In much the same fashion he discussed the existence of gases. What Kanada declared by sutra, Democritus declared by philosophical musing. Both suffered from a lack of empirical data. Without scientific proof, the existence of atoms was easy to deny. Aristotle opposed the existence of atoms in 330 BC. Earlier, in 380 BC, a Greek text attributed to Polybus argued that the human body is composed of four humours. Around 300 BC, Epicurus postulated a universe of indestructible atoms in which man himself is responsible for achieving a balanced life."

      "\n\nOne of Pak-un's classmates told reporters that he had told him that he was the son of the leader of North Korea. \nAccording to some reports, Kim was described by classmates as a shy child who was awkward with girls and indifferent to political issues, but who distinguished himself in sports and had a fascination with the American National Basketball Association and Michael Jordan. \nOne friend claimed that he had been shown pictures of Pak-un with Kobe Bryant and Toni Kukoƒç.In April 2012, new documents came to light indicating that Kim Jong-un had lived in Switzerland since 1991 or 1992, earlier than previously thought.The Laboratory of Anatomic Anthropology at the University of Lyon, France, compared the picture of Pak-un taken at the Liebefeld Steinh√∂lzli school in 1999 with a picture of Kim Jong-un from 2012 and concluded that the faces show a conformity of 95%, suggesting that it is most likely that they are the same person.The Washington Post reported in 2009 that Kim Jong-un's school friends recalled he \"spent hours doing meticulous pencil drawings of Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan\". \nHe was obsessed with basketball and computer games.Most analysts agree that Kim Jong-un attended Kim Il-sung University, a leading officer-training school in Pyongyang, from 2002 to 2007.

      "\n\nThese range from MMORPG to first-person shooters, from role-playing video games to online gambling. \nThis has revolutionized the way many people interact and spend their free time on the Internet. \nThe Internet has created social network services, forums of social interaction and social relations, such as Facebook, MySpace, Meetup, and CouchSurfing which facilitate both online and offline interaction. \nThe Internet is a relatively new phenomenon. \nAs Robert Darnton wrote, it is a revolutionary change that \"took place yesterday, or the day before, depending on how you measure it.\" \nThe Internet developed from the ARPANET, dating back to 1969; as a term it was coined in 1974. \nThe World Wide Web as we know it was shaped in the mid-1990s, when graphical interface and services like email became popular and reached wider (non-scientific and non-military) audiences and commerce. \nInternet Explorer was first released in 1995; Netscape a year earlier. \nGoogle was founded in 1998. \nWikipedia was founded in 2001. \nFacebook, MySpace, and YouTube in the mid-2000s. \nWeb 2.0 is still emerging. \nThe amount of information available on the net and the number of Internet users worldwide has continued to grow rapidly. \nThe term 'digital sociology' is now becoming increasingly used to denote new directions in sociological research into digital technologies since Web 2.0.",

      "\n\nPegasus Airlines: On 1 December 1989 two businesses, Net and Silkar, partnered with Aer Lingus to create an inclusive tour charter airline called Pegasus Airlines and services were inaugurated on 15 April 1990 with two Boeing 737‚Äì400s. \nIn Greek mythology, Pegasus (Greek: Œ†ŒÆŒ≥Œ±œÉŒøœÇ, P√©gasos, 'strong') was a winged horse sired by Poseidon, in his role as horse-god, and foaled by the Gorgon Medusa. \nHowever, four months after the launch, Iraq invaded Kuwait and the seven month occupation that followed had a serious effect on Turkish tourism. \nBy 1992, tourists began returning to the country and Pegasus grew with the acquisition of a third 737-400. \nThe airline leased a further two Airbus A320s to meet the summer demand.After two positive years, Aer Lingus and Net sold their shares in the company in 1994 to Istanbul-based Yapi Kredibank, making Pegasus a purely Turkish company.On 4 September 1997, Pegasus placed an order for one 737-400 and one 737‚Äì800 from Boeing Commercial Airplanes making it the first Turkish carrier to place an order for the Boeing 737 Next Generation. \nThe airline also signed lease agreements for a further 10 737-800s from the ILFC.In January 2005, ESAS Holdings purchased Pegasus Airlines and placed Ali Sabanci as the chairman. \nTwo months later, he changed the airline from a charter airline, to a low-cost airline.

      "\n\nDian Fossey: Although Fossey had always been an exemplary student, she had difficulties with basic sciences including chemistry and physics, and failed her second year of the program. She transferred to San Jose State College, where she became a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, to study occupational therapy, receiving her bachelor's degree in 1954. Initially following her college major, Fossey began a career in occupational therapy. She interned at various hospitals in California and worked with tuberculosis patients. Fossey was originally a prizewinning equestrian, which drew her to Kentucky in 1955, and a year later took a job as an occupational therapist at the Kosair Crippled Children's Hospital in Louisville.Her shy and reserved personality allowed her to work well with the children at the hospital. Fossey became close with her coworker Mary White \"Gaynee\" Henry, secretary to the hospital's chief administrator and the wife of one of the doctors, Michael J. Henry. The Henrys invited Fossey to join them on their family farm, where she worked with livestock on a daily basis and also experienced an inclusive family atmosphere that had been missing for most of her life. During her free time she would pursue her love of horses."
