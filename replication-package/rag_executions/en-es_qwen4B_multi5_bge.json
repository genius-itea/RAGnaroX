The sandfly becomes infected when biting an infected human in the period between 48 hours before the onset of fever and 24 hours after the end of the fever, and remains infected for its lifetime. Besides this horizontal virus transmission from man to sandfly, the virus can be transmitted in insects transovarially, from an infected female sandfly to its offspring.Pappataci fever is seldom recognised in endemic populations because it is mixed with other febrile illnesses of childhood, but it is more well-known among immigrants and military personnel from non-endemic regions."

      "\n\nHoward the Duck (film): Howard the Duck is a 1986 American comic science fiction film directed by Willard Huyck and starring Lea Thompson, Jeffrey Jones, and Tim Robbins. Based on the Marvel comic book of the same title, the film was produced by Gloria Katz and written by Huyck and Katz, with George Lucas as executive producer. The screenplay was originally intended to be an animated film, but the film adaptation became live-action because of a contractual obligation. Although several TV adaptations of Marvel characters had aired during the preceding 21 years, this was the first theatrically released feature film, coming after the serial Captain America.",
      "\n\nIn April 1998 Miramax Films acquired the rights to the novel The Reader, and principal photography began in September 2007 immediately after Stephen Daldry was signed to direct the film adaptation and Fiennes was cast in a lead role.  \nWinslet was originally cast as Hanna, but scheduling difficulties with Revolutionary Road led her to leave the film and Nicole Kidman was cast as her replacement. \nIn January 2008, Kidman left the project, citing her recent pregnancy as the primary reason. \nShe had not filmed any scenes yet, so the studio was able to recast Winslet without affecting the production schedule.Filming took place in Berlin, G√∂rlitz, on the Kirnitzschtal tramway near Bad Schandau, and was finished in Cologne on July 14. \nFilmmakers received $718,752 from Germany's Federal Film Board.  \nOverall, the studio received $4.1 million from Germany's regional and federal subsidiaries.Schlink insisted the film be shot in English rather than German, as it posed questions about living in a post-genocide society that went beyond mid-century Germany. \nDaldry and Hare toured locations from the novel with Schlink, viewed documentaries about that period in German history, and read books and articles about women who had served as SS guards in the camps. \nHare, who rejected using a voiceover narration to render the long internal monologues in the novel, also changed the ending so that Michael starts to tell the story of Hanna and him to his daughter.

      "\n\nIn the black-and-white standard, the ratio of audio subcarrier frequency to line frequency is ‚Äã4.5 MHz‚ÅÑ15,750 Hz = 285.71. \nIn the color standard, this becomes rounded to the integer 286, which means the color standard's line rate is ‚Äã4.5 MHz‚ÅÑ286 ‚âà 15,734 Hz. \nMaintaining the same number of scan lines per field (and frame), the lower line rate must yield a lower field rate. \nDividing ‚Äã4500000‚ÅÑ286 lines per second by 262.5 lines per field gives approximately 59.94 fields per second. \nThe National Television System Committee was established in 1940 by the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to resolve the conflicts between companies over the introduction of a nationwide analog television system in the United States. \nIn March 1941, the committee issued a technical standard for black-and-white television that built upon a 1936 recommendation made by the Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA). \nTechnical advancements of the vestigial side band technique allowed for the opportunity to increase the image resolution. \nThe NTSC selected 525 scan lines as a compromise between RCA's 441-scan line standard (already being used by RCA's NBC TV network) and Philco's and DuMont's desire to increase the number of scan lines to between 605 and 800. \nThe standard recommended a frame rate of 30 frames (images) per second, consisting of two interlaced fields per frame at 262.5 lines per field and 60 fields per second.

      "\n\nFor comparison, 576i systems such as PAL-B/G and SECAM use 625 lines (576 visible), and so have a higher vertical resolution, but a lower temporal resolution of 25 frames or 50 fields per second. \nThe 59.94 rate is derived from the following calculations. \nDesigners chose to make the chrominance subcarrier frequency an n + 0.5 multiple of the line frequency to minimize interference between the luminance signal and the chrominance signal. \n(Another way this is often stated is that the color subcarrier frequency is an odd multiple of half the line frequency.) \nThey then chose to make the audio subcarrier frequency an integer multiple of the line frequency to minimize visible (intermodulation) interference between the audio signal and the chrominance signal. \nThe original black-and-white standard, with its 15,750 Hz line frequency and 4.5 MHz audio subcarrier, does not meet these requirements, so designers had either to raise the audio subcarrier frequency or lower the line frequency. \nRaising the audio subcarrier frequency would prevent existing (black and white) receivers from properly tuning in the audio signal. \nLowering the line frequency is comparatively innocuous, because the horizontal and vertical synchronization information in the NTSC signal allows a receiver to tolerate a substantial amount of variation in the line frequency. \nSo the engineers chose the line frequency to be changed for the color standard.

Aqu√≠ te explico por qu√©:\n\n---\n\n### üîç 1. **Longitud del nervio**\nLos nervios m√°s largos (como los que van desde la espalda hasta los pies) tienen una **velocidad de conducci√≥n m√°s lenta** que los m√°s cortos.  \nüëâ Esto se debe a que la **velocidad de conducci√≥n es inversamente proporcional a la longitud del nervio**.  \nPor ejemplo, los nervios en los pies (que son m√°s largos) se ven afectados antes que los en las manos o en la cintura.\n\n> En la neuropat√≠a diab√©tica, esta diferencia se agrava porque el da√±o se produce m√°s en los nervios largos.\n\n---\n\n### üîç 2. **Da√±o a los vasos sangu√≠neos (isquemia nerviosa)**\nEn la diabetes, hay **deterioro de los peque√±os vasos sangu√≠neos** (microangiopat√≠a).  \nEsto impide que el nervio reciba suficiente ox√≠geno y nutrientes ‚Üí **isquemia nerviosa**.\n\nüëâ La **falta de ox√≠geno** afecta directamente el funcionamiento de las c√©lulas nerviosas, especialmente en las fibras de conducci√≥n.\n\n> Esto se relaciona con el hecho de que en la neuropat√≠a diab√©tica, la **velocidad de conducci√≥n se reduce** progresivamente.\n\n---\n\n### üîç 3. **Da√±o directo a las fibras nerviosas**\nLa **hiperglucemia cr√≥nica** (alto nivel de az√∫car en sangre) puede da√±ar directamente las fibras nerviosas, alterando su estructura y funci√≥n.  \nEsto afecta especialmente a las fibras de conducci√≥n m√°s lentas (como las fibras AŒ¥ y C), que son sensibles a los cambios metab√≥licos.\n\n---\n\n### üîç 4. **Fibra de conducci√≥n alterada**\n- En la neuropat√≠a diab√©tica, se observa una **p√©rdida de reflejos** y **perdida de sensibilidad**, especialmente en los dedos y en los pies.\n- Esto se debe a que las fibras que transmiten el impulso de forma lenta (fibras C) se ven afectadas primero.\n- Como resultado, el nervio **conduce m√°s lentamente** o incluso **no transmite el impulso** adecuadamente.\n\n---\n\n### üîç 5. **Vasodilatadores como los inhibidores de la enzima de conversi√≥n (ACE)**\n- Algunos medicamentos, como los **inhibidores de la enzima de conversi√≥n (ACE)**, mejoran el flujo sangu√≠neo a los nervios.\n- Esto **mejora la velocidad de conducci√≥n** porque los nervios reciben m√°s ox√≠geno y nutrientes.\n\n> Por eso se dice que la **deterioraci√≥n vascular** es una causa clave del deterioro funcional del nervio.\n\n---\n\n### ‚úÖ En resumen:\nLa velocidad de conductividad de un nervio se ve afectada porque:\n\n| Causa | Efecto |\n|------|--------|\n| **Longitud del nervio** | Los nervios largos se ven afectados primero |\n| **Isquemia (falta de ox√≠geno)** | Reduce la capacidad del nervio para transmitir se√±ales |\n| **Da√±o directo por hiperglucemia** | Afecta la estructura de las fibras nerviosas |\n| **Alteraci√≥n de la conducci√≥n nerviosa** | Se observa en forma de dolor, p√©rdida de sensaci√≥n, etc. |\n\n---\n\nüí° Como dice el texto original: *\"Longer nerve fibers are affected to a greater degree than shorter ones because nerve conduction velocity is slowed in proportion to a nerve's length.\"*\n\nüëâ As√≠ que, en resumen: **la velocidad de conductividad se reduce por la combinaci√≥n de da√±o vascular, hiperglucemia y longitud del nervio**.\n\n¬øQuieres que te explique esto con un ejemplo real o un dibujo mental? üòä",

    "response": "La disfunci√≥n de los peque√±os vasos sangu√≠neos es fundamental en la neuropat√≠a diab√©tica, ya que ocurre tempranamente en el proceso de la enfermedad y est√° estrechamente ligada al desarrollo y progresi√≥n de los da√±os nerviosos.\n\nA continuaci√≥n, se detallan sus principales importancias:\n\n1. **Inicio temprano de la enfermedad**: La disfunci√≥n vascular comienza desde los peque√±os vasos sangu√≠neos (como los capilares) en las primeras etapas del diabetes, incluso antes de que se manifiesten s√≠ntomas cl√≠nicos de neuropat√≠a. Esto sugiere que el da√±o vascular es un evento temprano y clave en el proceso patol√≥gico.\n\n2. **Relaci√≥n directa con la disfunci√≥n neuronal**: La disfunci√≥n vascular se asocia directamente con la disfunci√≥n nerviosa. A medida que los vasos sangu√≠neos se estrechan (narrowing), se reduce el flujo sangu√≠neo al nervio, lo que provoca **isquemia neuronal** (deficiencia de ox√≠geno y nutrientes). Esta hipoxia contribuye a la p√©rdida de funci√≥n nerviosa y al da√±o estructural del nervio.\n\n3. **Alteraciones en la microcirculaci√≥n**: Se observan cambios como **acumulaci√≥n de membrana basal en los capilares** y **hiperplasia endotelial**, que afectan la capacidad del vaso para regular el flujo sangu√≠neo. Estos cambios reducen la tensi√≥n de ox√≠geno en el tejido nervioso, favoreciendo la degeneraci√≥n de los nervios.\n\n4. **Sincronizaci√≥n del da√±o vascular y nervioso**: La disfunci√≥n neuronal y la disfunci√≥n vascular se desarrollan de manera paralela, lo que indica una relaci√≥n bidireccional. Los nervios dependen de un buen suministro sangu√≠neo, y los vasos dependen de una funci√≥n nerviosa adecuada para mantener su tono y funci√≥n. Esta interdependencia hace que ambos sistemas se da√±en mutuamente.\n\n5. **Explicaci√≥n de los s√≠ntomas cl√≠nicos**: La disfunci√≥n vascular se relaciona con s√≠ntomas como p√©rdida de sensibilidad (n√∫midos), dolor en las extremidades (especialmente en los pies), y p√©rdida de reflejos. El patr√≥n de distribuci√≥n \"como guantes y medias\" (glove-and-stocking distribution) se debe a que los nervios m√°s largos, como los de los pies, se ven m√°s afectados por el lentamiento de la conducci√≥n el√©ctrica, que est√° influenciado por la isquemia.\n\n6. **Factores de riesgo asociados**: La disfunci√≥n vascular est√° influenciada por factores como la **hiperglucemia**, la **hipertensi√≥n**, el **tabaquismo** y los **trastornos lip√≠dicos**, todos los cuales aumentan el riesgo de desarrollar neuropat√≠a diab√©tica.\n\nEn resumen, **la disfunci√≥n de los peque√±os vasos sangu√≠neos no es solo un aspecto secundario, sino un proceso central en la neuropat√≠a diab√©tica**, que act√∫a como un mecanismo clave para la isquemia nerviosa y el deterioro funcional. Por eso, el control de la glucemia, la presi√≥n arterial y la prevenci√≥n de factores de riesgo son esenciales no solo para prevenir la neuropat√≠a, sino tambi√©n para proteger la microcirculaci√≥n nerviosa.",

      "\n\nBlood vessel opening agents (e.g., ACE inhibitors, Œ±1-antagonists) can lead to substantial improvements in neuronal blood flow, with corresponding improvements in nerve conduction velocities. \nThus, small blood vessel dysfunction occurs early in diabetes, parallels the progression of neural dysfunction, and may be sufficient to support the severity of structural, functional, and clinical changes observed in diabetic neuropathy.",
      "\n\nHeparin: Heparin's normal role in the body is unclear. Heparin is usually stored within the secretory granules of mast cells and released only into the vasculature at sites of tissue injury. It has been proposed that, rather than anticoagulation, the main purpose of heparin is defense at such sites against invading bacteria and other foreign materials. In addition, it is observed across a number of widely different species, including some invertebrates that do not have a similar blood coagulation system. It is a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan. It has the highest negative charge density of any known biological molecule."

    "response": "¬°Ah, una excelente pregunta! Aunque no soy un experto en ciencias nucleares, puedo ayudarte con una explicaci√≥n clara basada en conocimientos cient√≠ficos.\n\nEl proceso mediante el cual un elemento se transforma en otro se llama **transformaci√≥n nuclear** o **desintegraci√≥n nuclear**. Este fen√≥meno ocurre cuando el n√∫cleo de un √°tomo es inestable y emite part√≠culas o radiaci√≥n para convertirse en un √°tomo diferente (es decir, de un elemento distinto).\n\n### ¬øC√≥mo se produce esta transformaci√≥n?\n\n1. **Desintegraci√≥n radiactiva**:  \n   Los √°tomos inestables (como el uranio o el torio) emiten part√≠culas (como electrones, protones o neutrinos) o radiaci√≥n (como rayos gamma) para alcanzar una configuraci√≥n m√°s estable.  \n   - **Desintegraci√≥n alfa**: Se emite un n√∫cleo de helio (2 protones y 2 neutrones). Esto reduce el n√∫mero at√≥mico en 2 y el n√∫mero masico en 4.  \n     Ejemplo: Uranio-238 ‚Üí Torio-234 + part√≠cula alfa  \n   - **Desintegraci√≥n beta**: Un neutr√≥n se convierte en un prot√≥n (o viceversa), lo que cambia el n√∫mero at√≥mico.  \n     Ejemplo: Carbono-14 ‚Üí Nitrogeno-14 + electr√≥n (beta)  \n   - **Desintegraci√≥n gamma**: Solo emite energ√≠a (rayos gamma), sin cambios en el n√∫mero de protones o neutrones, pero ayuda a estabilizar el n√∫cleo.\n\n2. **Fusi√≥n nuclear**:  \n   En condiciones extremas de temperatura y presi√≥n (como en el n√∫cleo de las estrellas), n√∫cleos ligeros se unen para formar n√∫cleos m√°s pesados.  \n   Ejemplo: 4 √°tomos de hidr√≥geno (protones) se fusionan para formar helio.  \n   ‚Üí Esto tambi√©n transforma un elemento en otro (hidr√≥geno ‚Üí helio).\n\n3. **Fisi√≥n nuclear**:  \n   Un n√∫cleo pesado se divide en dos n√∫cleos m√°s ligeros, liberando energ√≠a.  \n   Ejemplo: Uranio-235 se divide en fragmentos m√°s peque√±os (como bario y kript√≥n), liberando neutrones y energ√≠a.  \n   ‚Üí Esto tambi√©n transforma elementos pesados en m√°s ligeros.\n\n‚úÖ En resumen:  \n**Un elemento se transforma en otro cuando su n√∫cleo pierde o gana part√≠culas (protones o neutrones), o cuando se fusionan o dividen √°tomos.**\n\nüí° Este proceso no ocurre en la vida diaria, pero es fundamental en procesos como la radiaci√≥n, la energ√≠a nuclear, la formaci√≥n de estrellas, y la historia de la Tierra.\n\n¬øTe gustar√≠a que te d√© un ejemplo concreto paso a paso? üòä",

In 1924, four years prior to van der Laan's christening of the number's name, French engineer G√©rard Cordonnier had already discovered the number and referred to it as the radiant number (French: le nombre radiant). Unlike the names of the golden ratio and silver ratio, the word plastic was not intended by van der Laan to refer to a specific substance, but rather in its adjectival sense, meaning something that can be given a three-dimensional shape. This, according to Richard Padovan, is because the characteristic ratios of the number, 3/4 and 1/7, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church to these plastic number proportions.The plastic number is also sometimes called the silver number, a name given to it by Midhat J. Gazal√© and subsequently used by Martin Gardner, but that name is more commonly used for the silver ratio 1 + ‚àö2, one of the ratios from the family of metallic means first described by Vera W. de Spinadel in 1998.Donald E.

      "\n\nJoystick: A joystick is an input device consisting of a stick that pivots on a base and reports its angle or direction to the device it is controlling. \nA joystick, also known as the control column, is the principal control device in the cockpit of many civilian and military aircraft, either as a center stick or side-stick. \nIt often has supplementary switches to control various aspects of the aircraft's flight. \nAn arcade stick is a large-format controller for use with home consoles or computers. \nThey use the stick-and-button configuration of some arcade cabinets, such as those with particular multi-button arrangements. \nFor example, the six button layout of the arcade games Street Fighter II or Mortal Kombat cannot be comfortably emulated on a console joypad, so licensed home arcade sticks for these games have been manufactured for home consoles and PCs. \nIn the 1960s the use of joysticks became widespread in radio-controlled model aircraft systems such as the Kwik Fly produced by Phill Kraft (1964). \nThe now-defunct Kraft Systems firm eventually became an important OEM supplier of joysticks to the computer industry and other users. \nThe first use of joysticks outside the radio-controlled aircraft industry may have been in the control of powered wheelchairs, such as the Permobil (1963). \nDuring this time period NASA used joysticks as control devices as part of the Apollo missions. \nFor example, the lunar lander test models were controlled with a joystick.

In 1924, four years prior to van der Laan's christening of the number's name, French engineer G√©rard Cordonnier had already discovered the number and referred to it as the radiant number (French: le nombre radiant). Unlike the names of the golden ratio and silver ratio, the word plastic was not intended by van der Laan to refer to a specific substance, but rather in its adjectival sense, meaning something that can be given a three-dimensional shape. This, according to Richard Padovan, is because the characteristic ratios of the number, 3/4 and 1/7, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church to these plastic number proportions.The plastic number is also sometimes called the silver number, a name given to it by Midhat J.

      "\n\nCases in Lindi in which lions seize humans from the centres of substantial villages have been documented. \nAnother study of 1,000 people attacked by lions in southern Tanzania between 1988 and 2009 found that the weeks following the full moon, when there was less moonlight, were a strong indicator of increased night-time attacks on people.According to Robert R. \nFrump, Mozambican refugees regularly crossing Kruger National Park, South Africa, at night are attacked and eaten by lions; park officials have said man-eating is a problem there. \nFrump said thousands may have been killed in the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced refugees to cross the park at night. \nFor nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly crossed the park in daytime with little harm.Packer estimates between 200 and 400 Tanzanians are killed each year by wild animals and that lions are thought to kill at least 70 of these. \nAccording to Packer between 1990 and 2004, lions attacked 815 people in Tanzania and killed 563. \nPacker and Ikanda are among the few conservationists who believe western conservation efforts must take account of these matters because of ethical concerns about human life and the long-term success of conservation efforts and lion preservation.A man-eating lion was killed by game scouts in Southern Tanzania in April 2004. \nIt is believed to have killed and eaten at least 35 people in a series of incidents covering several villages in the coastal Rufiji Delta region. \nDr Rolf D. ",
      "\n\nBaldus, the GTZ wildlife programme coordinator, said it was likely that the lion preyed on humans because it had a large abscess beneath a cracked molar and wrote, \"This lion probably experienced a lot of pain, particularly when it was chewing\".\nThe \"All-Africa\" record of man-eating generally is considered to be a collection of incidents between the early 1930s and the late 1940s in modern-day Tanzania inflicted by a pride known as the \"Njombe lions\". \nGame warden and hunter George Rushby eventually dispatched the pride, which over three generations is thought to have killed and eaten 1,500 to 2,000 people in Njombe district.The area of the Gir National Park is now insufficient to sustain large lion numbers. \nLions dispersed outside the protected area and are a potential threat to people in and around the park. \nTwo attacks on humans were reported in 2012 in an area about 50‚Äì60 km (31‚Äì37 mi) from the sanctuary. \nThe lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae; it is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. \nThe lion is sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females with a typical weight range of 150 to 250 kg (330 to 550 lb) for males and 120 to 182 kg (265 to 400 lb) for females. ",
      "\n\nThe infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favoured by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans.In their analysis of man-eating ‚Äì including the Tsavo incident ‚Äì Kerbis Peterhans and Gnoske acknowledge that sick or injured animals may be more prone to man-eating but that the behaviour is \"not unusual, nor necessarily 'aberrant'\" where the opportunity exists; if inducements such as access to livestock or human corpses are present, lions will regularly prey upon human beings. \nThe authors note the relationship is well-attested among other pantherines and primates in the fossil record.The lion's proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. \nAmerican and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behaviour in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. \nAt least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period ‚Äì a number far exceeding the Tsavo attacks. \nThe incidents occurred near Selous National Park in Rufiji District and in Lindi Province near the Mozambican border. \nWhile the expansion of villages into bush country is one concern, the authors argue conservation policy must mitigate the danger because in this case, conservation contributes directly to human deaths.

These wars were the War of the Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì1748), the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763), the American Revolution (1765‚Äì1783), the French Revolutionary Wars (1793‚Äì1802) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803‚Äì1815).

In 1924, four years prior to van der Laan's christening of the number's name, French engineer G√©rard Cordonnier had already discovered the number and referred to it as the radiant number (French: le nombre radiant). Unlike the names of the golden ratio and silver ratio, the word plastic was not intended by van der Laan to refer to a specific substance, but rather in its adjectival sense, meaning something that can be given a three-dimensional shape. This, according to Richard Padovan, is because the characteristic ratios of the number, 3/4 and 1/7, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church to these plastic number proportions.The plastic number is also sometimes called the silver number, a name given to it by Midhat J. Gazal√© and subsequently used by Martin Gardner, but that name is more commonly used for the silver ratio 1 + ‚àö2, one of the ratios from the family of metallic means first described by Vera W. de Spinadel in 1998.Donald E.

      "\n\nSociology of the Internet: A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy is the use of peer-to-peer lending for charitable purposes. \nKiva pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding. \nKiva raises funds for local intermediary microfinance organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. \nLenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. \nKiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves. \nHowever, the recent spread of cheap Internet access in developing countries has made genuine peer-to-peer connections increasingly feasible. \nIn 2009 the US-based nonprofit Zidisha tapped into this trend to offer the first peer-to-peer microlending platform to link lenders and borrowers across international borders without local intermediaries. \nInspired by interactive websites such as Facebook and eBay, Zidisha's microlending platform facilitates direct dialogue between lenders and borrowers and a performance rating system for borrowers. \nWeb users worldwide can fund loans for as little as a dollar. \nGovernments are also getting online. \nSome countries, such as those of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Myanmar, the People's Republic of China, and Saudi Arabia use filtering and censoring software to restrict what people in their countries can access on the Internet.

      "\n\nWorld Wide Web: The proposal was modelled after the SGML reader Dynatext by Electronic Book Technology, a spin-off from the Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship at Brown University. \nThe Dynatext system, licensed by CERN, was a key player in the extension of SGML ISO 8879:1986 to Hypermedia within HyTime, but it was considered too expensive and had an inappropriate licensing policy for use in the general high energy physics community, namely a fee for each document and each document alteration. \nA NeXT Computer was used by Berners-Lee as the world's first web server and also to write the first web browser, WorldWideWeb, in 1990. \nBy Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web: the first web browser (which was a web editor as well) and the first web server. \nThe first web site, which described the project itself, was published on 20 December 1990.\nThe first web page may be lost, but Paul Jones of UNC-Chapel Hill in North Carolina announced in May 2013 that Berners-Lee gave him what he says is the oldest known web page during a 1991 visit to UNC. \nJones stored it on a magneto-optical drive and on his NeXT computer. \nOn 6 August 1991, Berners-Lee published a short summary of the World Wide Web project on the newsgroup alt.hypertext. \nThis date is sometimes confused with the public availability of the first web servers, which had occurred months earlier.

      "\n\nLess well-received was the voice acting which, although some reviewers remarked it was better than that found in the Resident Evil series, was found poor overall by reviewers, and accompanied by pauses between lines that served to spoil the atmosphere.Reviewers noted that Silent Hill used real-time 3D environments, in contrast to the pre-rendered environments found in Resident Evil. \nFog and darkness were heavily used to disguise the limitations of the hardware. \nAlong with the grainy textures‚Äîalso from hardware limitations‚Äîmost reviewers felt that these factors actually worked in the game's favor; Francesca Reyes of IGN described it as \"adding to the atmosphere of dilapidation and decay\". \nIn using 3D environments, however, controls became an issue, and in \"tougher\" areas, maneuverability became \"an exercise in frustration\".\nThe game's popularity as the first in the series was further recognized long after its release; a list of the best PS games of all time by IGN in 2000 listed it as the 14th-best PS game, while a 2005 article by GameSpy detailing the best PS games listed Silent Hill as the 15th-best game produced for the console. \nA GameTrailers video feature in 2006 ranked Silent Hill as number one in its list of the top ten scariest games of all time.

      "\n\nGeneral relativity: Soon after publishing the special theory of relativity in 1905, Einstein started thinking about how to incorporate gravity into his new relativistic framework. \nIn 1907, beginning with a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall, he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity. \nAfter numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations. \nThese equations specify how the geometry of space and time is influenced by whatever matter and radiation are present, and form the core of Einstein's general theory of relativity.The Einstein field equations are nonlinear and very difficult to solve. \nEinstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory. \nBut as early as 1916, the astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild found the first non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the Schwarzschild metric. \nThis solution laid the groundwork for the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes. \nIn the same year, the first steps towards generalizing Schwarzschild's solution to electrically charged objects were taken, which eventually resulted in the Reissner‚ÄìNordstr√∂m solution, now associated with electrically charged black holes. \nIn 1917, Einstein applied his theory to the universe as a whole, initiating the field of relativistic cosmology.

      "\n\nThe new theory claimed that the cause of the fall of Qin lay in the lack of thoroughness of Qin Shi Huang's \"dictatorship over the reactionaries, even to the extent of permitting them to worm their way into organs of political authority and usurp important posts.\" \nWith the coming of the Communist Revolution and the establishment of a new, revolutionary regime in 1949, another re-evaluation of the First Emperor emerged as a Marxist critique. \nThis new interpretation of Qin Shi Huang was generally a combination of traditional and modern views, but essentially critical. \nThis is exemplified in the Complete History of China, which was compiled in September 1955 as an official survey of Chinese history. \nThe work described the First Emperor's major steps toward unification and standardisation as corresponding to the interests of the ruling group and the merchant class, not of the nation or the people, and the subsequent fall of his dynasty as a manifestation of the class struggle. \nThe perennial debate about the fall of the Qin Dynasty was also explained in Marxist terms, the peasant rebellions being a revolt against oppression‚Äîa revolt which undermined the dynasty, but which was bound to fail because of a compromise with \"landlord class elements\"."

However, other research has postulated that the culture developed gradually and continuously, and that the introduction of Celtic language and elements of Celtic culture may have been a result of cultural exchange with Celtic groups in southwest continental Europe from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.The hypothesis that the native Late Bronze Age inhabitants gradually absorbed Celtic influences has since been supported by some recent genetic research.The Romans referred to Ireland as Scotia 500 CE, and later Hibernia. Ptolemy, in 100 CE, recorded Ireland's geography and tribes. Ireland was never a part of the Roman Empire, but Roman influence was often projected well beyond its borders. Tacitus writes that an exiled Irish prince was with Agricola in Roman Britain and would return to seize power in Ireland. Juvenal tells us that Roman \"arms had been taken beyond the shores of Ireland\". In recent years, some experts have hypothesized that Roman-sponsored Gaelic forces (or perhaps even Roman regulars) mounted some kind of invasion around 100 CE, but the exact relationship between Rome and the dynasties and peoples of Hibernia remains unclear.",

Estas t√©cnicas pueden variar mucho seg√∫n el contexto, como una conversaci√≥n casual, una interacci√≥n social, o incluso en entornos formales o creativos.\n\nAlgunas t√©cnicas comunes incluyen:\n\n- **Escuchar activamente**: Mostrar inter√©s genuino en lo que dice la otra persona genera conexi√≥n.\n- **Sonre√≠r y mantener contacto visual**: Esto transmite confianza y apertura.\n- **Hacer preguntas interesantes**: En lugar de responder con frases gen√©ricas, preguntar sobre experiencias personales o intereses espec√≠ficos puede hacer que la interacci√≥n sea m√°s profunda.\n- **Mostrar autenticidad**: Las personas suelen ser m√°s atra√≠das por quienes parecen aut√©nticas, no por quienes intentan ser perfectas.\n- **Usar humor o iron√≠a adecuada**: Puede hacer que una conversaci√≥n sea m√°s agradable y memorable.\n- **Ser emp√°tica**: Demostrar que se preocupa por el estado emocional de la otra persona genera un v√≠nculo emocional.\n\nEs importante recordar que atraer la atenci√≥n no tiene que ser una competencia.

      "\n\nPlastic number: Dutch architect & Benedictine monk Dom Hans van der Laan gave the name plastic number (Dutch: het plastische getal) to this number in 1928. In 1924, four years prior to van der Laan's christening of the number's name, French engineer G√©rard Cordonnier had already discovered the number and referred to it as the radiant number (French: le nombre radiant). Unlike the names of the golden ratio and silver ratio, the word plastic was not intended by van der Laan to refer to a specific substance, but rather in its adjectival sense, meaning something that can be given a three-dimensional shape. This, according to Richard Padovan, is because the characteristic ratios of the number, 3/4 and 1/7, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church to these plastic number proportions.The plastic number is also sometimes called the silver number, a name given to it by Midhat J. Gazal√© and subsequently used by Martin Gardner, but that name is more commonly used for the silver ratio 1 + ‚àö2, one of the ratios from the family of metallic means first described by Vera W. de Spinadel in 1998.Donald E.

Recent scholarship has yielded a more comprehensive view of Mary Shelley's achievements. Scholars have shown increasing interest in her literary output, particularly in her novels, which include the historical novels Valperga (1823) and Perkin Warbeck (1830), the apocalyptic novel The Last Man (1826), and her final two novels, Lodore (1835) and Falkner (1837). Studies of her lesser-known works, such as the travel book Rambles in Germany and Italy (1844) and the biographical articles for Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia (1829‚Äì1846), support the growing view that Mary Shelley remained a political radical throughout her life. Mary Shelley's works often argue that cooperation and sympathy, particularly as practised by women in the family, were the ways to reform civil society. This view was a direct challenge to the individualistic Romantic ethos promoted by Percy Shelley and the Enlightenment political theories articulated by her father, William Godwin.",

In 1924, four years prior to van der Laan's christening of the number's name, French engineer G√©rard Cordonnier had already discovered the number and referred to it as the radiant number (French: le nombre radiant). Unlike the names of the golden ratio and silver ratio, the word plastic was not intended by van der Laan to refer to a specific substance, but rather in its adjectival sense, meaning something that can be given a three-dimensional shape. This, according to Richard Padovan, is because the characteristic ratios of the number, 3/4 and 1/7, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church to these plastic number proportions.The plastic number is also sometimes called the silver number, a name given to it by Midhat J. Gazal√© and subsequently used by Martin Gardner, but that name is more commonly used for the silver ratio 1 + ‚àö2, one of the ratios from the family of metallic means first described by Vera W. de Spinadel in 1998.Donald E.

      "\n\nPlastic number: Dutch architect & Benedictine monk Dom Hans van der Laan gave the name plastic number (Dutch: het plastische getal) to this number in 1928. In 1924, four years prior to van der Laan's christening of the number's name, French engineer G√©rard Cordonnier had already discovered the number and referred to it as the radiant number (French: le nombre radiant). Unlike the names of the golden ratio and silver ratio, the word plastic was not intended by van der Laan to refer to a specific substance, but rather in its adjectival sense, meaning something that can be given a three-dimensional shape. This, according to Richard Padovan, is because the characteristic ratios of the number, 3/4 and 1/7, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church to these plastic number proportions.The plastic number is also sometimes called the silver number, a name given to it by Midhat J. Gazal√© and subsequently used by Martin Gardner, but that name is more commonly used for the silver ratio 1 + ‚àö2, one of the ratios from the family of metallic means first described by Vera W. de Spinadel in 1998.Donald E.

      "\n\nThe cancer spread to her spine by the autumn of 1900, and as she worried about her personal letters (in which she detailed her concern over Germany's future under her son) falling into the hands of the emperor, she requested that the letters be brought back to Great Britain in a cloak-and-dagger operation by her godson Frederick Ponsonby, the private secretary of her brother King Edward VII, who was making his final visit to his terminally ill sister in Kronberg on 23 February 1901. \nThese letters were later edited by Ponsonby and put into context by his background commentary to form the book that was published in 1928. \nWith the death of King Frederick William IV on 2 January 1861, his brother, who had acted as regent since 1858, ascended the throne as King William I. \nFrederick was then the new crown prince of Prussia but his situation at court did not change much: his father refused to increase his allowance, and Crown Princess Victoria continued to contribute significantly to the family budget with her dowry and allowance. \nIn a letter to the Baron von Stockmar, Prince Albert commented on the situation:",
      "\n\nHowever, Prince Albert did succeed in imposing Ernst Alfred Christian von Stockmar, the son of his friend Baron von Stockmar, as his daughter's private secretary.Convinced that the marriage of a British princess to the second-in-line to the Prussian throne would be regarded as an honour by the Hohenzollerns, Prince Albert insisted that his daughter retain her title of Princess Royal after the wedding. \nHowever, owing to the very anti-British and pro-Russian views of the Berlin court, the prince's decision only aggravated the situation.The question of where to hold the marriage ceremony raised the most criticism. \nTo the Hohenzollerns, it seemed natural that the nuptials of the future Prussian king would be held in Berlin. \nHowever, Queen Victoria insisted that her eldest daughter must marry in her own country, and in the end, she prevailed. \nThe wedding of Victoria and Frederick took place at the Chapel Royal of St. \nJames's Palace in London on 25 January 1858. \nVictoria devoted part of her final years to painting and to visiting the artists' colony of Kronberg, where she regularly met with the painter Norbert Schr√∂dl. \nIn her last days she used to walk in the morning and spent long hours writing letters or reading in the library of her castle.In late 1898, physicians diagnosed the empress dowager with inoperable breast cancer, forcing her to stay in bed for long periods. ",
      "\n\nFrederick welcomed the creation of the North German Confederation, which joined Prussia and some Germanic principalities, because he saw that it was the first step toward German unification. \nHowever, the Confederation was far from adopting the liberal ideas of the crown prince. \nDespite being democratically elected, the Reichstag did not have the same powers as a British Parliament. \nIn addition, local sovereigns were more interested in maintaining their prerogatives, and the new German constitution gave many powers to the now Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. \nLess enthusiastic than her husband, Vicky saw the North German Confederation as an extension of the Prussian political system she hated. \nNevertheless, she remained hopeful that this situation was temporary and that a united and liberal Germany could be created. \nAt 17 years old, Victoria had to perform many tedious official duties. \nAlmost every evening, she had to appear at formal dinners, theatrical performances or public receptions. \nIf foreign relatives of the Hohenzollerns were located in Berlin or Potsdam, her protocolary duties widened. \nSometimes she was forced to greet guests of the royal family at the station at 7:00 in the morning and be present at receptions past midnight.Upon the arrival of Victoria in Berlin, King Frederick William IV gave to Frederick and his wife an old wing of the Berlin Royal Palace. \nThe building was in very bad condition, and it did not even contain a bathtub. \nThe couple moved to the Kronprinzenpalais in November 1858.

      "\n\nMilk clashes with the local gay \"establishment\" which he feels to be too cautious and risk-averse. \nIn early 1991, Oliver Stone was planning to produce, but not direct, a film on Milk's life; he wrote a script for the film, called The Mayor of Castro Street. \nIn July 1992, director Gus Van Sant was signed with Warner Bros. to direct the biopic with actor Robin Williams in the lead role. \nBy April 1993, Van Sant parted ways with the studio, citing creative differences. \nOther actors considered for Harvey Milk at the time included Richard Gere, Daniel Day-Lewis, Al Pacino, and James Woods. \nMilk and White forge a complex working relationship. \nMilk is invited to, and attends, the christening of White's first child, and White asks for Milk's assistance in preventing a psychiatric hospital from opening in White's district, possibly in exchange for White's support of Milk's citywide gay rights ordinance. \nWhen Milk fails to support White because of the negative effect it will have on troubled youth, White feels betrayed, and ultimately becomes the sole vote against the gay rights ordinance. \nMilk also launches an effort to defeat Proposition 6, an initiative on the California state ballot in November 1978. \nSponsored by John Briggs, a conservative state legislator from Orange County, Proposition 6 seeks to ban gays and lesbians (in addition to anyone who supports them) from working in California's public schools.

      "\n\nLess well-received was the voice acting which, although some reviewers remarked it was better than that found in the Resident Evil series, was found poor overall by reviewers, and accompanied by pauses between lines that served to spoil the atmosphere.Reviewers noted that Silent Hill used real-time 3D environments, in contrast to the pre-rendered environments found in Resident Evil. \nFog and darkness were heavily used to disguise the limitations of the hardware. \nAlong with the grainy textures‚Äîalso from hardware limitations‚Äîmost reviewers felt that these factors actually worked in the game's favor; Francesca Reyes of IGN described it as \"adding to the atmosphere of dilapidation and decay\". \nIn using 3D environments, however, controls became an issue, and in \"tougher\" areas, maneuverability became \"an exercise in frustration\".\nThe game's popularity as the first in the series was further recognized long after its release; a list of the best PS games of all time by IGN in 2000 listed it as the 14th-best PS game, while a 2005 article by GameSpy detailing the best PS games listed Silent Hill as the 15th-best game produced for the console. \nA GameTrailers video feature in 2006 ranked Silent Hill as number one in its list of the top ten scariest games of all time.

      "\n\nPlastic number: Dutch architect & Benedictine monk Dom Hans van der Laan gave the name plastic number (Dutch: het plastische getal) to this number in 1928. In 1924, four years prior to van der Laan's christening of the number's name, French engineer G√©rard Cordonnier had already discovered the number and referred to it as the radiant number (French: le nombre radiant). Unlike the names of the golden ratio and silver ratio, the word plastic was not intended by van der Laan to refer to a specific substance, but rather in its adjectival sense, meaning something that can be given a three-dimensional shape. This, according to Richard Padovan, is because the characteristic ratios of the number, 3/4 and 1/7, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church to these plastic number proportions.The plastic number is also sometimes called the silver number, a name given to it by Midhat J. Gazal√© and subsequently used by Martin Gardner, but that name is more commonly used for the silver ratio 1 + ‚àö2, one of the ratios from the family of metallic means first described by Vera W. de Spinadel in 1998.Donald E.

      "\n\nHistory of Ireland: Linguists realised from the 17th century onwards that the language spoken by these people, the Goidelic languages, was a branch of the Celtic languages. This is usually explained as a result of invasions by Celts from the continent. However, other research has postulated that the culture developed gradually and continuously, and that the introduction of Celtic language and elements of Celtic culture may have been a result of cultural exchange with Celtic groups in southwest continental Europe from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.The hypothesis that the native Late Bronze Age inhabitants gradually absorbed Celtic influences has since been supported by some recent genetic research.The Romans referred to Ireland as Scotia 500 CE, and later Hibernia. Ptolemy, in 100 CE, recorded Ireland's geography and tribes. Ireland was never a part of the Roman Empire, but Roman influence was often projected well beyond its borders. Tacitus writes that an exiled Irish prince was with Agricola in Roman Britain and would return to seize power in Ireland. Juvenal tells us that Roman \"arms had been taken beyond the shores of Ireland\". In recent years, some experts have hypothesized that Roman-sponsored Gaelic forces (or perhaps even Roman regulars) mounted some kind of invasion around 100 CE, but the exact relationship between Rome and the dynasties and peoples of Hibernia remains unclear."

      "\n\nRobot-assisted surgery: The first robot to assist in surgery was the Arthrobot, which was developed and used for the first time in Vancouver in 1985. \nThis robot assisted in being able to manipulate and position the patient‚Äôs leg on voice command. \nIntimately involved were biomedical engineer Dr. \nJames McEwen, Geof Auchinleck, a UBC engineering physics grad, and Dr. \nBrian Day as well as a team of engineering students. \nThe robot was used in an orthopaedic surgical procedure on 12 March 1984, at the UBC Hospital in Vancouver. \nOver 60 arthroscopic surgical procedures were performed in the first 12 months, and a 1985 National Geographic video on industrial robots, The Robotics Revolution, featured the device. \nOther related robotic devices developed at the same time included a surgical scrub nurse robot, which handed operative instruments on voice command, and a medical laboratory robotic arm. \nA YouTube video entitled Arthrobot- the world's first surgical robot illustrates some of these in operation.In 1985 a robot, the Unimation Puma 200, was used to orient a needle for a brain biopsy while under CT guidance during a neurological procedure. \nIn the late 1980s, Imperial College in London developed PROBOT, which was then used to perform prostatic surgery. \nThe advantages to this robot was its small size, accuracy and lack of fatigue for the surgeon. \nIn 1992, the ROBODOC was introduced and revolutionized orthopedic surgery by being able to assist with hip replacement surgeries.

Aunque no tengo acceso directo a un corpus de texto espec√≠fico como el que mencionas, puedo darte una explicaci√≥n clara y basada en conocimientos generales (y que podr√≠as encontrar en fuentes como \"History of chemistry\" o \"Statistics\", aunque no sean directamente sobre monedas):\n\nLa **depreciaci√≥n de las monedas** se produce cuando el valor de una moneda nacional disminuye en relaci√≥n con otras monedas extranjeras. Esto puede ocurrir por varias razones:\n\n1. **Inflaci√≥n alta**: Cuando el precio de los bienes y servicios aumenta r√°pidamente (inflaci√≥n), la moneda pierde valor porque cada unidad de dinero compra menos.\n2. **Sobreexplotaci√≥n de las reservas internacionales**: Si un pa√≠s tiene poca cantidad de divisas extranjeras (como d√≥lares o euros), puede perder confianza en su moneda.\n3. **Sobrecarga de deuda externa**: Si un pa√≠s tiene grandes deudas en moneda extranjera y no puede pagarlas, los inversores pueden perder confianza y desinversionar, lo que disminuye el valor de la moneda.\n4. **Pol√≠ticas econ√≥micas inestables**: Cambios bruscos en tasas de inter√©s, regulaciones fiscales o falta de control en la econom√≠a pueden hacer que los inversores eviten invertir en esa moneda.\n5. **Crecimiento econ√≥mico d√©bil o desaceleraci√≥n**: Si el pa√≠s no est√° creciendo, los inversores podr√≠an preferir otras monedas m√°s estables.\n6. **Sensibilidad a la volatilidad de los mercados**: En tiempos de crisis globales (como pandemias o conflictos), muchos pa√≠ses ven caer su moneda.\n\nüí° *Por ejemplo, en el contexto de Mongolia, que tiene una econom√≠a dependiente de las exportaciones y altos niveles de inflaci√≥n en ciertos per√≠odos, la moneda local puede verse afectada por condiciones clim√°ticas o econ√≥micas extremas ‚Äî algo que podr√≠a relacionarse con el \"efecto de invenci√≥n de temperatura\" mencionado en el texto sobre Siberia (aunque eso es un ejemplo figurado).*\n\n¬øQuieres que te lo explique de forma m√°s sencilla o con un ejemplo real de un pa√≠s? üòä",

      "\n\nFrench colonial empire: In the middle of the 18th century, a series of colonial conflicts began between France and Britain, which ultimately resulted in the destruction of most of the first French colonial empire and the near-complete expulsion of France from the Americas. These wars were the War of the Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì1748), the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763), the American Revolution (1765‚Äì1783), the French Revolutionary Wars (1793‚Äì1802) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803‚Äì1815). It may even be seen further back in time to the first of the French and Indian Wars. This cyclic conflict is sometimes known as the Second Hundred Years' War. The French colonial empire began to fall during the Second World War, when various parts were occupied by foreign powers (Japan in Indochina, Britain in Syria, Lebanon, and Madagascar, the United States and Britain in Morocco and Algeria, and Germany and Italy in Tunisia). However, control was gradually reestablished by Charles de Gaulle. The French Union, included in the Constitution of 1946, nominally replaced the former colonial empire, but officials in Paris remained in full control. The colonies were given local assemblies with only limited local power and budgets. There emerged a group of elites, known as evolu√©s, who were natives of the overseas territories but lived in metropolitan France.",

      "\n\nAnt-Man: Ant-Man is the name of several fictional superheroes appearing in books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby, Ant-Man's first appearance was in Tales to Astonish #35 (September 1962). The persona was originally the brilliant scientist Hank Pym's superhero alias after inventing a substance that can change size, but Scott Lang and Eric O'Grady also took on the mantle after the original changed his superhero identity to various other aliases, such as Giant-Man, Goliath, and Yellowjacket. Scott Lang was a thief who became Ant-Man after stealing the Ant-Man suit to save his daughter Cassandra \"Cassie\" Lang from a heart condition. Reforming from his life of crime, Lang soon took on a full-time career as Ant-Man with the encouragement of Hank Pym. He became an affiliate of the Fantastic Four, and later became a full-time member of the Avengers. For a period of time he dated Jessica Jones. He was killed by the Scarlet Witch along with the Vision and Hawkeye in Avengers Disassembled, and his daughter took up his heroic mantle as Stature in the book Young Avengers. He returned to life in 2011 in the mini series, The Children's Crusade, but lost his daughter when she heroically sacrificed herself to stop a super charged Doctor Doom, who would later revive her during the AXIS.",
      "\n\nHybrid Theory: Linkin Park was founded in 1996 as the rap rock band Xero: lead guitarist Brad Delson, vocalist and rhythm guitarist Mike Shinoda, drummer Rob Bourdon, turntablist Joe Hahn, lead vocalist Mark Wakefield and bassist Dave Farrell (who subsequently left to tour with Tasty Snax). \nIn 1999, after Wakefield's departure, lead vocalist Chester Bennington joined the five members of Xero and the band was renamed Linkin Park. \nBennington's previous band, Grey Daze, had recently disbanded, so his lawyer recommended him to Jeff Blue, vice president of A&R coordination for Zomba, who at the time was seeking a lead vocalist for Xero. \nBlue sent Bennington two tapes of Xero's unreleased recordings ‚Äî one with vocals by former Xero member Mark Wakefield, and the other with only the instrumental tracks ‚Äî asking for his \"interpretation of the songs\". \nBennington wrote and recorded new vocals over the instrumentals and sent the tapes back to Blue. \nAs Delson recalls, \"[Bennington] really was kind of the final piece of the puzzle [...] \nWe didn't see anything close to his talent in anybody else.\" \nAfter Bennington joined, the group first renamed itself to Hybrid Theory and released a self-titled EP. \nLegal complications with Welsh electronic music group Hybrid prompted a second name change, thus deciding on \"Linkin Park\".

The Milky Way Galaxy, where our own Solar System is located, is classified as a barred spiral galaxy.Edwin Hubble classified spiral galaxies of this type as \"SB\" (spiral, barred) in his Hubble sequence and arranged them into sub-categories based on how open the arms of the spiral are. SBa types feature tightly bound arms, while SBc types are at the other extreme and have loosely bound arms. SBb-type galaxies lie in between the two. SB0 is a barred lenticular galaxy. A new type, SBm, was subsequently created to describe somewhat irregular barred spirals, such as the Magellanic Clouds, which were once classified as irregular galaxies, but have since been found to contain barred spiral structures. Among other types in Hubble's classifications for the galaxies are the spiral galaxy, elliptical galaxy and irregular galaxy.",

      "\n\nHistory of Singapore: After the Japanese surrender to the Allies on 15 August 1945, Singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder; looting and revenge-killing were widespread. \nBritish troops led by Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander for Southeast Asia Command, returned to Singapore to receive formal surrender of the Japanese forces in the region from General Itagaki Seishiro on behalf of General Hisaichi Terauchi on 12 September 1945, and a British Military Administration was formed to govern the island until March 1946. \nMuch of the infrastructure had been destroyed during the war, including electricity and water supply systems, telephone services, as well as the harbor facilities at the Port of Singapore. \nThere was also a shortage of food leading to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. \nHigh food prices, unemployment, and workers' discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services. \nBy late 1947, the economy began to recover, facilitated by a growing demand for tin and rubber around the world, but it would take several more years before the economy returned to pre-war levels.The failure of Britain to defend Singapore had destroyed its credibility as infallible ruler in the eyes of Singaporeans. \nThe decades after the war saw a political awakening amongst the local populace and the rise of anti-colonial and nationalist sentiments, epitomized by the slogan Merdeka, or \"independence\" in the Malay language. ",
      "\n\nThe British, on their part, were prepared to gradually increase self-governance for Singapore and Malaya. \nOn 1 April 1946, the Straits Settlements was dissolved and Singapore became a separate Crown Colony with a civil administration headed by a Governor. \nIn July 1947, separate Executive and Legislative Councils were established and the election of six members of the Legislative Council was scheduled in the following year. \nDavid Marshall, leader of the Labour Front, became the first Chief Minister of Singapore. \nHe presided over a shaky government, receiving little cooperation from either the colonial government or the other local parties. \nSocial unrest was on the rise, and in May 1955, the Hock Lee bus riots broke out, killing four people and seriously discrediting Marshall's government. \nIn 1956, the Chinese middle school riots broke out among students in The Chinese High School and other schools, further increasing the tension between the local government and the Chinese students and unionists who were regarded of having communist sympathies. \nDuring World War 2, Singapore was conquered and occupied by the Japanese Empire from 1942 to 1945. \nWhen the war ended, Singapore reverted to British control, with increasing levels of self-government being granted, culminating in Singapore's merger with the Federation of Malaya to form Malaysia in 1963. \nHowever, social unrest and disputes between Singapore's ruling People's Action Party and Malaysia's Alliance Party resulted in Singapore's expulsion from Malaysia. \nSingapore became an independent republic on 9 August 1965.

      "\n\nThe proliferation of squatter settlements resulted in safety hazards and caused the Bukit Ho Swee Fire in 1961 that killed four people and left 16,000 others homeless. \nThe Housing Development Board set up before independence continued to be largely successful and huge building projects sprung up to provide affordable public housing to resettle the squatters. \nWithin a decade, the majority of the population had been housed in these apartments. \nThe Central Provident Fund (CPF) Housing Scheme, introduced in 1968, allows residents to use their compulsory savings account to purchase HDB flats and gradually increases home ownership in Singapore.British troops had remained in Singapore following its independence, but in 1968, London announced its decision to withdraw the forces by 1971. \nWith the secret aid of military advisers from Israel, Singapore rapidly established the Singapore Armed Forces, with the help of a national service program introduced in 1967. \nSince independence, Singaporean defense spending has been approximately five percent of GDP.  \nToday, the Singapore Armed Forces are among the best-equipped in Asia. \nThe status of a British outpost in Singapore seemed initially in doubt as the Dutch government soon protested to Britain for violating the Netherlands' sphere of influence. \nBut as Singapore rapidly emerged as an important trading post, Britain consolidated its claim on the island.

      "\n\nThe Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 cemented the status of Singapore as a British possession, carving up the Malay archipelago between the two colonial powers with the area north of the Straits of Malacca, including Singapore, falling under Britain's sphere of influence. \nIn 1826, Singapore was grouped by the British East India Company together with Penang and Malacca to form the Straits Settlements, administered by the British East India Company. \nIn 1830, the Straits Settlements became a residency, or subdivision, of the Presidency of Bengal in British India.During the subsequent decades, Singapore grew to become an important port in the region. \nIts success was due to several reasons including the opening of the Chinese market, the advent of ocean-going steamships, the dramatic reduction in the time and cost of shipping goods to Europe after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, and the production of rubber and tin in Malaya. \nIts status as a free port provided a crucial advantage over other colonial port cities in Batavia (now Jakarta) and Manila where tariffs were levied, and it drew many Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Arab traders operating in South-East Asia to Singapore. \nThe later opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 would further boost trade in Singapore. \nBy 1880, over 1.5 million tons of goods were passing through Singapore each year, with around 80% of the cargo transported by steamships. \nThe main commercial activity was entrep√¥t trade which flourished under no taxation and little restriction.

      "\n\nLength contraction: Heavy ions that are spherical when at rest should assume the form of \"pancakes\" or flat disks when traveling nearly at the speed of light. And in fact, the results obtained from particle collisions can only be explained when the increased nucleon density due to length contraction is considered. It was the negative result of a famous experiment, that required the introduction of length contraction: the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment (and later also the Kennedy‚ÄìThorndike experiment). In special relativity its explanation is as follows: In its rest frame the interferometer can be regarded as at rest in accordance with the relativity principle, so the propagation time of light is the same in all directions. Although in a frame in which the interferometer is in motion, the transverse beam must traverse a longer, diagonal path with respect to the non-moving frame thus making its travel time longer, the factor by which the longitudinal beam would be delayed by taking times L/(c-v) & L/(c+v) for the forward and reverse trips respectively is even longer. Therefore, in the longitudinal direction the interferometer is supposed to be contracted, in order to restore the equality of both travel times in accordance with the negative experimental result(s). Thus the two-way speed of light remains constant and the round trip propagation time along perpendicular arms of the interferometer is independent of its motion & orientation.",

Heparin is usually stored within the secretory granules of mast cells and released only into the vasculature at sites of tissue injury.

In addition, it is observed across a number of widely different species, including some invertebrates that do not have a similar blood coagulation system. It is a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan.

In the same year as the CS2 release, Adobe Systems announced an agreement to acquire Macromedia in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion and it integrated the companies' operations, networks, and customer-care organizations shortly thereafter.  Adobe now owned FreeHand along with the entire Macromedia product line and in 2007, Adobe announced that it would discontinue development and updates to the FreeHand program. Instead, Adobe would provide tools and support to ease the transition to Illustrator.CS3 included interface updates to the Control Bar, the ability to align individual points, multiple Crop Areas, the Color Guide panel and the Live Color feature among others.

Recent scholarship has yielded a more comprehensive view of Mary Shelley's achievements. Scholars have shown increasing interest in her literary output, particularly in her novels, which include the historical novels Valperga (1823) and Perkin Warbeck (1830), the apocalyptic novel The Last Man (1826), and her final two novels, Lodore (1835) and Falkner (1837). Studies of her lesser-known works, such as the travel book Rambles in Germany and Italy (1844) and the biographical articles for Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia (1829‚Äì1846), support the growing view that Mary Shelley remained a political radical throughout her life. Mary Shelley's works often argue that cooperation and sympathy, particularly as practised by women in the family, were the ways to reform civil society. This view was a direct challenge to the individualistic Romantic ethos promoted by Percy Shelley and the Enlightenment political theories articulated by her father, William Godwin."

Reims is one of the most successful clubs in French football history having won six Ligue 1 titles, two Coupe de France trophies, and five Troph√©e des champions titles. The club has also performed well on European level having finished as runners-up in the 1956 and 1959 editions of the European Cup and winning the Latin Cup and Coppa delle Alpi in 1953 and 1977, respectively. However, since the 1980s, Reims have struggled to get back to their zenith.

      "\n\nPhilosopher's stone: Early medieval alchemists built upon the work of Zosimos in the Byzantine Empire and the Arab empires. \nByzantine and Arab alchemists were fascinated by the concept of metal transmutation and attempted to carry out the process. \nThe 8th-century Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan (Latinized as Geber) analyzed each classical element in terms of the four basic qualities. \nFire was both hot and dry, earth cold and dry, water cold and moist, and air hot and moist. \nHe theorized that every metal was a combination of these four principles, two of them interior and two exterior. \nFrom this premise, it was reasoned that the transmutation of one metal into another could be affected by the rearrangement of its basic qualities. \nThis change would be mediated by a substance, which came to be called xerion in Greek and al-iksir in Arabic (from which the word elixir is derived). \nIt was often considered to exist as a dry red powder (also known as al-kibrit al-ahmar, red sulfur) made from a legendary stone‚Äîthe philosopher's stone. \nThe elixir powder came to be regarded as a crucial component of transmutation by later Arab alchemists.In the 11th century, there was a debate among Muslim world chemists on whether the transmutation of substances was possible.

      "\n\nThe new theory claimed that the cause of the fall of Qin lay in the lack of thoroughness of Qin Shi Huang's \"dictatorship over the reactionaries, even to the extent of permitting them to worm their way into organs of political authority and usurp important posts.\" \nWith the coming of the Communist Revolution and the establishment of a new, revolutionary regime in 1949, another re-evaluation of the First Emperor emerged as a Marxist critique. \nThis new interpretation of Qin Shi Huang was generally a combination of traditional and modern views, but essentially critical. \nThis is exemplified in the Complete History of China, which was compiled in September 1955 as an official survey of Chinese history. \nThe work described the First Emperor's major steps toward unification and standardisation as corresponding to the interests of the ruling group and the merchant class, not of the nation or the people, and the subsequent fall of his dynasty as a manifestation of the class struggle. \nThe perennial debate about the fall of the Qin Dynasty was also explained in Marxist terms, the peasant rebellions being a revolt against oppression‚Äîa revolt which undermined the dynasty, but which was bound to fail because of a compromise with \"landlord class elements\".",

Although infection may be caused by direct injury from the fish fins or bites, most are acquired during the handling of the aquariums such as cleaning or changing the water.

He and his wife were admired for their rearing of their four sons. He was succeeded as king by his son Eumenes II. Attalus won an important victory over the Galatians, newly arrived Celtic tribes from Thrace, who had been, for more than a generation, plundering and exacting tribute throughout most of Asia Minor without any serious check. This victory, celebrated by the triumphal monument at Pergamon (famous for its Dying Gaul) and the liberation from the Gallic \"terror\" which it represented, earned for Attalus the name of \"Soter\", and the title of \"king\". A courageous and capable general and loyal ally of Rome, he played a significant role in the first and second Macedonian Wars, waged against Philip V of Macedon.

      "\n\nDemyansk Pocket: Between the forming of the pocket in early February to the abandonment of Demyansk in May, the two pockets (including Kholm) received 65,000 short tons (59,000 t) of supplies (both through ground and aerial delivery), 31,000 replacement troops, and 36,000 wounded were evacuated. The supplies were delivered through over 100 flights of whitewashed Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft per day. However, the cost was significant. The Luftwaffe lost 265 aircraft, including 106 Junkers Ju 52, 17 Heinkel He 111 and two Junkers Ju 86 aircraft. In addition, 387 airmen were lost. Richard Overy argues that the Demyansk airlift was a Pyrrhic victory, citing the loss of over 200 aircraft and their crew \"when annual production of transports was running at only 500; and all to save 90,000 German soldiers, 64,000 of whom were either killed, wounded or too sick for service\" by the airlift's end.Fighting in the area continued until 28 February 1943. The Soviet forces did not retake Demyansk until 1 March 1943, with the organized withdrawal of the German troops.",

      "\n\nKesha: After failing to negotiate with Lava Records and Atlantic Records in 2009, Kesha signed a multi-album deal with RCA Records through Dr. \nLuke's imprint. \nHaving spent the previous six years working on material for her debut album, she began putting finishing touches to the album with Luke and Max Martin. \nFor the album, she wrote 200 songs. \nThe album was executive produced by Luke, who produced the majority of the songs with Martin, and producers Benny Blanco and Ammo. \nThe album is primarily of the electropop genre, marking a shift in sound for Luke from his signature pop rock productions. \nAnimal debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 when it was released in January 2010. \nIt was certified Platinum in the United States and had sold two million albums worldwide by September of that year. \nThe album's lead single, \"Tik Tok\", broke the record in the United States for the highest sales week for a single, with 610,000 digital downloads sold in a single week, the highest ever by a female artist since digital download tracking began in 2003. \nIt spent nine weeks at number one in the country and became there the longest running number-one by a female artist on her debut single since Debby Boone and \"You Light Up My Life\" in 1977. \nAs of 2015, \"Tik Tok\" has sold about 15 million copies worldwide, becoming the second best-selling single in digital history and the best-selling digital single in history by a female solo artist.
