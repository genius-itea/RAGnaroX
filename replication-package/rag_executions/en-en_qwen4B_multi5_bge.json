    "response": "No, an infection in sandflies does not go away over time — rather, the sandfly itself becomes infected and remains infected for its lifetime.\n\nIn the case of *Pappataci fever*, the virus is transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies (such as *Phlebotomus papatasi*). When a sandfly bites an infected human — specifically between 48 hours before the onset of fever and 24 hours after the fever ends — it becomes infected. This infection is **not temporary**; the sandfly remains infected for life and can then transmit the virus to other humans through subsequent bites.\n\nAdditionally, the virus can be passed from infected female sandflies to their offspring through *transovarial transmission*, meaning the infection is inherited and persists in the next generation.\n\nSo, while the **human** may recover from Pappataci fever, the **sandfly** remains a carrier and is not cured — it stays infected for life.",

      "\n\nPappataci fever: Pappataci fever is prevalent in the subtropical zone of the Eastern Hemisphere between 20°N and 45°N, particularly in Southern Europe, North Africa, the Balkans, Eastern Mediterranean, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and India.The disease is transmitted by the bites of phlebotomine sandflies of the Genus Phlebotomus, in particular, Phlebotomus papatasi, Phlebotomus perniciosus and Phlebotomus perfiliewi. The sandfly becomes infected when biting an infected human in the period between 48 hours before the onset of fever and 24 hours after the end of the fever, and remains infected for its lifetime. Besides this horizontal virus transmission from man to sandfly, the virus can be transmitted in insects transovarially, from an infected female sandfly to its offspring.Pappataci fever is seldom recognised in endemic populations because it is mixed with other febrile illnesses of childhood, but it is more well-known among immigrants and military personnel from non-endemic regions.",
      "\n\nMycobacterium marinum: Although Aronson isolated this mycobacterium in 1926 from a fish, it was not until 1951 that it was found to be the cause of human disease by Linell and Norden. Large outbreaks of infection due to this atypical mycobacterium have been described in association with swimming. Infections related to swimming pools have now drastically fallen due to the improvements in the construction and maintenance of these facilities.The first case of M. marinum infection associated with a fish-tank ('fish-tank granuloma') was reported in 1962 by Swift and Cohen. M. marinum infection may be an occupational hazard for certain professions such as pet shop workers, but most infections occur in fish fanciers who keep an aquarium at home. Although infection may be caused by direct injury from the fish fins or bites, most are acquired during the handling of the aquariums such as cleaning or changing the water. Indirect infection has also been described related to a child’s bathing utensils that had been used to clean a fish tank. Due to an increased awareness of the disease and improved isolation methods, more and more cases are being recognized and reported worldwide.",

    "reference": "vertical synchronization and retrace",
    "response": "CRT TVs needed a vertical blanking interval to allow the electron beam to return to the top of the screen after completing one full vertical scan of the image. \n\nDuring this interval, the beam doesn't draw any visible picture elements—it simply moves rapidly from the bottom of the screen back to the top (a process called vertical retrace). This blanking period was essential for several reasons:\n\n1. **Mechanical and Electronic Reset**: Early CRTs used cathode-ray tubes where the electron beam physically sweeps across the screen. After reaching the bottom, the beam had to be repositioned to start the next frame. The vertical blanking interval provided the time needed for this retrace without drawing any image content.\n\n2. **Avoiding Image Artifacts**: If the beam were to draw a line during retrace, it would cause visible \"traces\" or \"flicker\" on the screen—disturbing the viewer. The blanking interval prevented this by ensuring the screen was blank during retrace.\n\n3. **Synchronization**: The blanking interval also allowed time for synchronization signals (like vertical sync pulses) to be sent to the TV receiver, ensuring that the electron beam started each frame at the correct position.\n\n4. **Time for Additional Data**: In modern implementations, part of this blanking interval can now carry extra information like closed captioning or vertical interval timecode (VITC), though originally it was purely for retrace and synchronization.\n\nSo, in short: the vertical blanking interval was a necessary technical feature to allow the CRT to refresh the screen smoothly and without visual artifacts.",

    "reference": "support the severity of structural, functional, and clinical changes observed in diabetic neuropathy.",
    "response": "The dysfunction of small blood vessels plays a crucial and early role in the development and progression of diabetic neuropathy. Here's why it's so important:\n\n1. **Early Pathological Change**: The first observable change in small blood vessels in diabetes is narrowing (atherosclerosis or vascular narrowing), which reduces blood flow to peripheral nerves. This impaired blood flow leads to **neuronal ischemia**—a state of insufficient oxygen and nutrients reaching the nerves—making it a well-established hallmark of diabetic neuropathy.\n\n2. **Correlation with Nerve Dysfunction**: As blood flow diminishes, nerve function declines. The dysfunction of small blood vessels **parallels and drives** the progression of neural damage. This means that as blood vessels become abnormal (e.g., with capillary basement membrane thickening and endothelial hyperplasia), nerves become increasingly damaged and dysfunctional.\n\n3. **Contributor to Hypoxia**: Reduced blood flow leads to **diminished oxygen tension (hypoxia)** in nerves. Since nerves require a constant supply of oxygen and glucose to function properly, this hypoxia directly contributes to nerve cell injury and degeneration.\n\n4. **Bidirectional Relationship with Nerves**: There’s a **close interplay** between nerves and blood vessels. Nerves need adequate blood flow to survive, and blood vessels depend on normal nerve function to regulate vascular tone and blood pressure. This creates a vicious cycle: poor blood flow damages nerves, and damaged nerves impair vascular regulation, further worsening blood flow.\n\n5. **Improvement with Vascular Therapy**: Interventions that improve blood flow—such as **ACE inhibitors or α1-antagonists**—can enhance neuronal blood flow and improve nerve conduction velocities. This shows that addressing vascular dysfunction can directly benefit nerve function, highlighting its therapeutic importance.\n\n6. **Link to Autonomic Neuropathy**: In autonomic neuropathy, small blood vessel dysfunction affects organs like the heart and blood vessels, impairing their ability to regulate blood pressure (e.g., orthostatic hypotension). This shows how vascular issues extend beyond peripheral nerves to systemic complications.\n\nIn summary, small blood vessel dysfunction is not just a secondary feature but a **primary driver** of diabetic neuropathy.

It was built first in 1800 by Sultan Selim III for the soldiers of the newly established  Nizam-ı Cedid (literally \"New Order\") in frame of the Ottoman military reform efforts. The initially wooden barracks was designed by Krikor Balyan. It was burnt down in 1806 by revolting Janissaries, who were against the reforms. Ordered by Sultan Mahmud II, rebuilding of the barracks in stone began in 1825 and it was completed on 6 February 1828. It is a gigantic rectangle building 200 m × 267 m (656 ft × 876 ft) with a large parade ground in the centre. The structure has three floors on three wings and two floors only on the eastern wing due to inclined terrain. During the reign of Sultan Abdülmecid I, the barracks were renovated twice, first in 1842–43 and again in 1849–50. During this process, a tower seven stories in height was added to each of the four corners, giving the barracks the look they have today.",

From 24 April 1978, when former Paraguay President Federico Chávez died, until his own death Bayar was the world's oldest living former head of state. Mahmut Celâl Bayar (16 May 1883 – 22 August 1986) was a Turkish politician, who was the third President of Turkey from 1950 to 1960; previously he was Prime Minister of Turkey from 1937 to 1939. Bayar, as the Turkish President, was decorated with the Legion of Merit by the President of the United States, as a result of Turkey's participation in the Korean War. He is considered to be the longest-lived former head of state and was the longest-lived state leader until 8 December 2008 (when he was surpassed by Chau Sen Cocsal Chhum). Celal Bayar died on 22 August 1986 at the age of 103 after a brief illness. On 1 November 1937 Mustafa Kemal Atatürk appointed Bayar as Prime Minister of the 9th Government of Turkey after İsmet İnönü left the government. He continued to serve as prime minister when Atatürk died and İnönü became president in 1938 (10th government of Turkey). Differences of opinion with Inönü led him to resign from the position on 25 January 1939."

      "\n\nJoystick: A joystick is an input device consisting of a stick that pivots on a base and reports its angle or direction to the device it is controlling. \nA joystick, also known as the control column, is the principal control device in the cockpit of many civilian and military aircraft, either as a center stick or side-stick. \nIt often has supplementary switches to control various aspects of the aircraft's flight. \nAn arcade stick is a large-format controller for use with home consoles or computers. \nThey use the stick-and-button configuration of some arcade cabinets, such as those with particular multi-button arrangements. \nFor example, the six button layout of the arcade games Street Fighter II or Mortal Kombat cannot be comfortably emulated on a console joypad, so licensed home arcade sticks for these games have been manufactured for home consoles and PCs. \nIn the 1960s the use of joysticks became widespread in radio-controlled model aircraft systems such as the Kwik Fly produced by Phill Kraft (1964). \nThe now-defunct Kraft Systems firm eventually became an important OEM supplier of joysticks to the computer industry and other users. \nThe first use of joysticks outside the radio-controlled aircraft industry may have been in the control of powered wheelchairs, such as the Permobil (1963). \nDuring this time period NASA used joysticks as control devices as part of the Apollo missions. \nFor example, the lunar lander test models were controlled with a joystick.

Positioned as the low end of the MacBook family, below the premium ultra-portable MacBook Air and the powerful MacBook Pro,  the MacBook was aimed at the consumer and education markets.  It was the best-selling Macintosh ever. For five months in 2008, it was the best-selling laptop of any brand in US retail stores.  Collectively, the MacBook brand is the \"world's top-selling line of premium laptops.\"There have been four separate designs of the MacBook. The original model used a combination of polycarbonate and fiberglass casing which was modeled after the iBook G4. The second type was introduced in October 2008 alongside the 15-inch MacBook Pro; the MacBook shared the more expensive laptop's unibody aluminium casing, but omitted FireWire.

Notably:\n\n- The **World Wide Web** was introduced in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee. He built the first web browser (WorldWideWeb) and the first web server on a NeXT Computer. The first website, describing the project itself, was published on December 20, 1990.\n\n- By 1991, Berners-Lee published a summary of the World Wide Web project on the newsgroup *alt.hypertext*, marking the beginning of broader public awareness and adoption of the web.\n\n- The Dynatext system, which influenced the development of the web, had been adapted to support hypermedia in the HyTime standard, although it was considered too expensive and restrictive for general use in the high-energy physics community.\n\nThese developments laid the foundation for the modern internet and web-based communication, making the 1990s a pivotal decade for digital technology.",

He served as provisional President of the Republic from 23 October 1989 to 2 May 1990. His presidency occurred during Hungary's transition from Communism to democratic government.Szűrös served as Speaker of the National Assembly of Hungary from March 1989 to May 1990. In the fall of 1989, as part of an agreement between the Communists and the opposition to establish multiparty democracy, the 1949 Constitution was almost completely rewritten to remove its Communist character. The Presidential Council, the country's Communist-era collective presidency, was dissolved. Under the Constitution, Szűrös became provisional president until the election. Soon after taking office on 23 October he made the official proclamation that Hungary had removed the \"People's Republic\" from its constitutional name and was now the \"Republic of Hungary.\"",

    "response": "When it comes to mobile networking, a **security standard** refers to the set of protocols, policies, and technologies designed to protect data, ensure privacy, and prevent unauthorized access while using mobile networks—especially in public or shared environments.\n\nKey aspects of mobile networking security standards include:\n\n1. **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**:  \n   Since mobile users often rely on public networks (like 3G, 4G, or 5G), they must use secure connections such as VPNs to encrypt data and protect sensitive information from eavesdropping or interception. Without proper encryption, data transmitted over public networks can be easily compromised.\n\n2. **Authentication and Encryption Protocols**:  \n   Standards like **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** and **IPsec** are used to authenticate users and encrypt data in transit. These ensure that only authorized users can access network resources and that data remains confidential.\n\n3. **Network-Level Security (e.g., EAP, 802.1X)**:  \n   These protocols secure access to wireless networks by validating user identities before granting network access—commonly used in enterprise mobile environments.\n\n4. **Mobile Device Management (MDM)**:  \n   Security standards extend to managing mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets), enforcing policies such as encryption, remote wipe, and app restrictions to protect corporate or personal data.\n\n5. **Secure Communication Protocols**:  \n   Standards such as **HTTPS**, **SFTP**, and **WPA3** (for Wi-Fi) ensure secure data transmission between devices and servers.\n\n6. **Anti-Interception and Intrusion Prevention**:  \n   Given the interconnected nature of mobile networks, standards help detect and prevent attacks such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where attackers intercept communication between a user and a server.\n\n7. **Compliance with Regulations**:  \n   Standards like **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)** or **HIPAA** (in healthcare) require mobile apps and services to handle personal and sensitive data securely.\n\nIn summary, **a security standard in mobile networking** ensures that data transmitted over mobile connections is protected from unauthorized access, tampering, or theft—especially important when users are on public networks, traveling, or handling sensitive information. This is a major concern in mobile computing, where reliance on public infrastructure increases exposure to cyber threats.",

      "\n\nGeneral Packet Radio Service: GPRS is a best-effort service, implying variable throughput and latency that depend on the number of other users sharing the service concurrently, as opposed to circuit switching, where a certain quality of service (QoS) is guaranteed during the connection.  In 2G systems, GPRS provides data rates of 56–114 kbit/sec. 2G cellular technology combined with GPRS is sometimes described as 2.5G, that is, a technology between the second (2G) and third (3G) generations of mobile telephony. It provides moderate-speed data transfer, by using unused time division multiple access (TDMA) channels in, for example, the GSM system. GPRS is integrated into GSM Release 97 and newer releases. Using the CS-4 it is possible to achieve a user speed of 20.0 kbit/s per time slot. However, using this scheme the cell coverage is 25% of normal. CS-1 can achieve a user speed of only 8.0 kbit/s per time slot, but has 98% of normal coverage. Newer network equipment can adapt the transfer speed automatically depending on the mobile location."

    "response": "External factors that could interfere with cellphone reception in tunnels or buildings include:\n\n- **Physical barriers**: Thick concrete, steel, and other dense materials in buildings and tunnel walls can block or weaken radio signals.\n- **Distance from signal towers**: Cellphones rely on signals transmitted from nearby cell towers. Being far from a tower—such as in deep tunnels or remote areas—reduces signal strength.\n- **Signal reflection and interference**: In buildings, signals can bounce off walls and ceilings, causing multipath interference, which degrades reception quality.\n- **Weather conditions**: Rain, snow, or heavy fog can slightly weaken radio signals, especially over long distances or in poor line-of-sight environments.\n- **Terrain and topography**: Mountains, hills, or large natural obstacles can obstruct direct signal paths, affecting reception in certain areas.\n\nThese factors are mentioned in the provided text under the section on *Transmission interferences*, which notes that weather, terrain, and distance from the nearest signal point can all interfere with signal reception—particularly in tunnels, some buildings, and rural areas.",

      "\n\nValentine's Day: In Chinese, Valentine's Day is called lovers' festival (simplified Chinese: 情人节; traditional Chinese: 情人節; Mandarin: Qīng Rén Jié; Hokkien: Chêng Lîn Chiat; Cantonese: Chìhng Yàhn Jit; Shanghainese Xin Yin Jiq). \nThe \"Chinese Valentine's Day\" is the Qixi Festival, celebrated on the seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar. \nIt commemorates a day on which a legendary cowherder and weaving maid are allowed to be together. \nIn Chinese culture, there is an older observance related to lovers, called \"The Night of Sevens\" (Chinese: 七夕; pinyin: Qi Xi). \nAccording to the legend, the Cowherd star and the Weaver Maid star are normally separated by the Milky Way (silvery river) but are allowed to meet by crossing it on the 7th day of the 7th month of the Chinese calendar.In recent years, celebrating White Day has also become fashionable among some young people. \nIn Denmark and Norway, February 14 is known as Valentinsdag, and it is celebrated in much the same manner as in the United Kingdom. \nIn Sweden it is called Alla hjärtans dag (\"All Hearts' Day\") and is not widely celebrated. \nA 2016 survey revealed that less than 50% of men and women were planning to buy presents for their partners. \nThe holiday has only been observed since the 1960s.

In **Denmark and Norway**, it's known as **Valentinsdag** and is celebrated similarly to the UK.\n- **White Day**: In Japan and some other countries, **White Day** follows Valentine's Day, where recipients give gifts (often sweets) back to those who gave chocolates.\n\n### Fun Facts:\n- In the U.S., Valentine's Day has only been widely observed since the 1960s.\n- A 2016 survey found that **less than 50% of men and women** planned to buy gifts for their partners.\n- In **Brazil**, Valentine's Day isn't celebrated due to the timing of Carnival, which often occurs between February and March.\n\nSo, while Valentine's Day is globally recognized, its meaning and traditions vary widely across cultures — from romantic gestures to expressions of friendship or even national traditions. 💘",

It was sculpted by Guido Galletti, based on an idea of Italian diving instructor Duilio Marcante. The statue was placed near the spot where Dario Gonzatti, the first Italian to use SCUBA gear, died in 1947. It depicts Christ offering a benediction of peace, with his head and hands raised skyward. The statue was subsequently dedicated to the memory of Marcante.Due to increasing amounts of corrosion and the growth of crustaceans, the statue was removed from the water and restored in 2003.

    "response": "Colour comes from how objects interact with light. According to Isaac Newton's theory of colour, colour is not generated by objects themselves, but rather results from how objects absorb, reflect, or transmit already-coloured light. For example, when a coloured beam of light shines on an object, the object may reflect certain wavelengths (which we perceive as colour) while absorbing others. The colour we see is thus the reflection of the light that the object has not absorbed.\n\nIn simpler terms, if a red apple appears red, it is because it reflects red light and absorbs other colours (like blue and green). So, colour is a property of the interaction between light and matter — not something created by the object alone.",

    "response": "Newton's idea of terrestrial gravity was that the same force responsible for objects falling to Earth also governs the motion of celestial bodies, such as the Moon orbiting the Earth. He proposed that gravity extends beyond Earth's surface and acts with an inverse-square law—meaning the strength of the gravitational force decreases proportionally to the square of the distance from the center of the Earth (or any mass).\n\nSpecifically, Newton realized that if gravity decreased as the inverse square of the distance, then the gravitational pull of Earth could indeed account for the Moon's orbital motion. By calculating the Moon’s orbital period and comparing it to the acceleration due to gravity on Earth, he found a close agreement with the inverse-square law. This led him to conclude that the force of gravity, which pulls objects toward the Earth's surface, is the same force that keeps the Moon in orbit.\n\nHe named this universal force \"universal gravitation,\" suggesting that gravity is not limited to Earth but is a universal force acting between all masses in the universe.

      "\n\nThe resulting Newton–Cartan theory is a geometric formulation of Newtonian gravity using only covariant concepts, i.e. a description which is valid in any desired coordinate system. \nIn this geometric description, tidal effects—the relative acceleration of bodies in free fall—are related to the derivative of the connection, showing how the modified geometry is caused by the presence of mass. \nGeneral relativity (GR, also known as the general theory of relativity or GTR) is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and the current description of gravitation in modern physics. \nGeneral relativity generalizes special relativity and supersedes Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. \nIn particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. \nThe relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations. \nIn general relativity, no material body can catch up with or overtake a light pulse. \nNo influence from an event A can reach any other location X before light sent out at A to X. \nIn consequence, an exploration of all light worldlines (null geodesics) yields key information about the spacetime's causal structure.

      "\n\nFifth force: A new fundamental force might be difficult to test. Gravity, for example, is such a weak force that the gravitational interaction between two objects is only significant when one of them has a great mass. Therefore, it takes very sensitive equipment to measure gravitational interactions between objects that are small compared to the Earth. A new (or \"fifth\") fundamental force might similarly be weak and therefore difficult to detect. Nonetheless, in the late 1980s a fifth force, operating on municipal scales (i.e. with a range of about 100 meters), was reported by researchers (Fischbach et al.) who were reanalyzing results of Loránd Eötvös from earlier in the century. The force was believed to be linked with hypercharge. Over a number of years, other experiments have failed to duplicate this result.There are at least three kinds of searches that can be undertaken, which depend on the kind of force being considered, and its range. Some speculative theories have proposed a fifth force to explain various anomalous observations that do not fit existing theories.  The characteristics of this fifth force depend on the theory being advanced. Many postulate a force roughly the strength of gravity (i.e. it is much weaker than electromagnetism or the nuclear forces) with a range of anywhere from less than a millimeter to cosmological scales. Another proposal is a new weak force, mediated by W′ and Z′ bosons.",

      "\n\nSeveral other agents were developed after the Second World War, the most popular and reasonably effective of which were tetramethylammonium chloride, hexamethonium, hydralazine, and reserpine (derived from the medicinal plant Rauwolfia serpentina). \nNone of these were well tolerated. \nA major breakthrough was achieved with the discovery of the first well-tolerated orally available agents. \nThe first was chlorothiazide, the first thiazide diuretic and developed from the antibiotic sulfanilamide, which became available in 1958. \nSubsequently, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and renin inhibitors were developed as antihypertensive agents. \nModern understanding of the cardiovascular system began with the work of physician William Harvey (1578–1657), who described the circulation of blood in his book \"De motu cordis\". \nThe English clergyman Stephen Hales made the first published measurement of blood pressure in 1733.  \nHowever, hypertension as a clinical entity came into its own with the invention of the cuff-based sphygmomanometer by Scipione Riva-Rocci in 1896. \nThis allowed easy measurement of systolic pressure in the clinic. \nIn 1905, Nikolai Korotkoff improved the technique by describing the Korotkoff sounds that are heard when the artery is ausculted with a stethoscope while the sphygmomanometer cuff is deflated.

      "\n\nAt the base of classical mechanics is the notion that a body's motion can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion. \nSuch deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. \nThe preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. \nIn modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.Conversely, one might expect that inertial motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), can be used to define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate. \nHowever, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. \nAccording to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors (see Eötvös experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties.

This includes checking for signs like:\n   - Swelling (edema)\n   - Headaches\n   - Visual disturbances (e.g., \"flashing lights\")\n   - Stomach pain\n\n3. **Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests**:  \n   Additional tests may be used to identify the cause or assess organ damage:\n   - **Serum creatinine** is measured to evaluate kidney function, as kidney disease can be both a cause and result of hypertension.\n   - **Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)** is calculated using formulas like the **MDRD** or **CKD-EPI** to better assess kidney function.\n   - **Urine protein testing** helps detect proteinuria (protein in the urine), which can signal kidney damage or secondary hypertension.\n   - Tests for **diabetes** and **high cholesterol** are often performed, as these conditions are closely linked to cardiovascular risk and hypertension.\n\n4. **Classification of Hypertension**:  \n   Hypertension is categorized into stages:\n   - **Stage I**: Systolic 130–139 mmHg or diastolic 80–89 mmHg\n   - **Stage II**: Systolic ≥140 mmHg or diastolic ≥90 mmHg\n   - **Isolated Systolic Hypertension**: Elevated systolic pressure with normal diastolic pressure, common in older adults\n   - **Stage III**: Systolic >179 mmHg or diastolic >109 mmHg\n   - **Resistant Hypertension**: When medications fail to bring blood pressure down to normal levels\n\n5. **Special Cases**:  \n   In pregnancy, hypertension may be classified as:\n   - **Pre-existing hypertension** (already present before pregnancy)\n   - **Gestational hypertension** (develops after 20 weeks)\n   - **Pre-eclampsia** (high blood pressure with protein in urine, occurring in about 5% of pregnancies and a major cause of maternal mortality)\n\nIn summary, hypertension is found through repeated blood pressure checks, clinical evaluation, and supportive laboratory tests to determine its cause and impact on organs.

Over the past years, participation has grown significantly, with record engagement from 47 member countries in 2007.\n\n2. **Public Outreach and Media Campaigns:** During the week of WHD, member countries collaborate with local governments, professional societies, non-governmental organizations, and private industries to promote hypertension awareness. These efforts use mass media such as television, the internet, and public rallies to reach millions of people — with campaigns reaching over 250 million individuals in recent years.\n\n3. **Education and Prevention:** The WHL works to combat the fact that more than 50% of people with hypertension are unaware of their condition. By promoting awareness, the WHL encourages early diagnosis, lifestyle changes (such as limiting alcohol intake to no more than 3 units per day for men and 2 units per day for women), and better management of blood pressure.\n\n4. **Global Collaboration:** The WHL, which includes 85 national hypertension societies and leagues, fosters international cooperation to develop and share best practices in hypertension prevention and treatment.\n\nOverall, the WHL’s efforts focus on improving public understanding, encouraging early detection, and promoting lifestyle modifications to reduce the global burden of hypertension.",

      "\n\nEmma Goldman: Although she was hostile to the suffragist goals of first-wave feminism, Goldman advocated passionately for the rights of women, and is today heralded as a founder of anarcha-feminism, which challenges patriarchy as a hierarchy to be resisted alongside state power and class divisions. \nIn 1897, she wrote: \"I demand the independence of woman, her right to support herself; to live for herself; to love whomever she pleases, or as many as she pleases. \nI demand freedom for both sexes, freedom of action, freedom in love and freedom in motherhood.\"\nA nurse by training, Goldman was an early advocate for educating women concerning contraception. \nLike many feminists of her time, she saw abortion as a tragic consequence of social conditions, and birth control as a positive alternative. \nGoldman was also an advocate of free love, and a strong critic of marriage. \nShe saw early feminists as confined in their scope and bounded by social forces of Puritanism and capitalism. \nShe wrote: \"We are in need of unhampered growth out of old traditions and habits. \nThe movement for women's emancipation has so far made but the first step in that direction.\"\nGoldman was also an outspoken critic of prejudice against homosexuals. \nHer belief that social liberation should extend to gay men and lesbians was virtually unheard of at the time, even among anarchists.

These grievances were used to rally public support for independence and to frame the British monarchy as oppressive and unjust in the eyes of the American colonists.\n\nSo, to answer your question: King George III was not accused of a single crime in the Declaration of Independence, but rather of a pattern of actions—such as imposing taxes without consent, suppressing colonial self-government, and using force—described as establishing an \"absolute tyranny.\"",

      "\n\nIn early 1778, France (Britain's chief rival) signed a treaty of alliance with the United States and the conflict escalated. \nThe United States and France were soon joined by Spain and the Dutch Republic, while Britain had no major allies of its own. \nLord Gower and Lord Weymouth both resigned from the government. \nLord North again requested that he also be allowed to resign, but he stayed in office at George III's insistence. \nOpposition to the costly war was increasing, and in June 1780 contributed to disturbances in London known as the Gordon riots.As late as the Siege of Charleston in 1780, Loyalists could still believe in their eventual victory, as British troops inflicted heavy defeats on the Continental forces at the Battle of Camden and the Battle of Guilford Court House. \nIn late 1781, the news of Lord Cornwallis's surrender at the Siege of Yorktown reached London; Lord North's parliamentary support ebbed away and he resigned the following year. \nThe King drafted an abdication notice, which was never delivered, finally accepted the defeat in North America, and authorised peace negotiations. \nThe Treaties of Paris, by which Britain recognised the independence of the American states and returned Florida to Spain, were signed in 1782 and 1783. \nWhen John Adams was appointed American Minister to London in 1785, George had become resigned to the new relationship between his country and the former colonies. ",
      "\n\nFrench colonial empire: In the middle of the 18th century, a series of colonial conflicts began between France and Britain, which ultimately resulted in the destruction of most of the first French colonial empire and the near-complete expulsion of France from the Americas. These wars were the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the American Revolution (1765–1783), the French Revolutionary Wars (1793–1802) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815). It may even be seen further back in time to the first of the French and Indian Wars. This cyclic conflict is sometimes known as the Second Hundred Years' War. The French colonial empire began to fall during the Second World War, when various parts were occupied by foreign powers (Japan in Indochina, Britain in Syria, Lebanon, and Madagascar, the United States and Britain in Morocco and Algeria, and Germany and Italy in Tunisia). However, control was gradually reestablished by Charles de Gaulle. The French Union, included in the Constitution of 1946, nominally replaced the former colonial empire, but officials in Paris remained in full control. The colonies were given local assemblies with only limited local power and budgets. There emerged a group of elites, known as evolués, who were natives of the overseas territories but lived in metropolitan France."

    "response": "The British did not increase taxes in the context of the provided text. In fact, the text highlights that the American colonists were generally *unburdened by British taxes*, and the central issue for them was not the amount of taxation, but whether Parliament could levy taxes without American approval—specifically, the principle of \"no taxation without representation.\"\n\nThe text does mention a specific tax introduced in 1765: the **Stamp Act**, which imposed a stamp duty on every document in the American colonies. This tax was controversial because it was seen as a violation of colonial rights. The colonists protested, arguing that they had the same rights as Englishmen and should not be taxed without their consent. Newspapers, which were printed on stamped paper, were especially affected and became powerful tools in spreading opposition to the tax.\n\nSo, to clarify:\n\n- The British did **not** increase taxes for the purpose of raising revenue in a way that was acceptable to the colonists.\n- The **Stamp Act** was introduced, not because of a need for increased revenue, but because the British government believed it was appropriate for the colonies to contribute to the defense of the empire (e.g., against Native American uprisings or French incursions).\n- The colonists objected not to the *amount* of the tax, but to the *lack of representation* in Parliament.\n\nTherefore, the British did not increase taxes because they were trying to increase revenue; rather, they believed the colonies had a duty to help fund colonial defense, and this led to a conflict over legitimacy and self-governance.",

      "\n\nPakistan: Four periods are recognised in Pakistani architecture: pre-Islamic, Islamic, colonial, and post-colonial. \nWith the beginning of the Indus civilization around the middle of the 3rd millennium BCE, an advanced urban culture developed for the first time in the region, with large buildings, some of which survive to this day. \nMohenjo Daro, Harappa, and Kot Diji are among the pre-Islamic settlements that are now tourist attractions. \nThe rise of Buddhism and the influence of Greek civilisation led to the development of a Greco-Buddhist style, starting from the 1st century CE. \nThe high point of this era was the Gandhara style. \nAn example of Buddhist architecture is the ruins of the Buddhist monastery Takht-i-Bahi in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. \nMost sports played in Pakistan originated and were substantially developed by athletes and sports fans from the United Kingdom who introduced them during the British Raj. \nField hockey is the national sport of Pakistan; it has won three gold medals in the Olympic Games held in 1960, 1968, and 1984. \nPakistan has also won the Hockey World Cup a record four times, held in 1971, 1978, 1982, and 1994.\nCricket, however, is the most popular game across the country.

The principle was intended to ease the transition and reduce resistance from the local populations, while securing China’s sovereignty.\n\nThus, Deng Xiaoping’s key suggestion in the 1980s was the \"One Country, Two Systems\" model to ensure a peaceful and stable return of Hong Kong and Macau to China.",

This coloration is the same in both genders.The song of the American goldfinch is a series of musical warbles and twitters, often with a long note. A tsee-tsi-tsi-tsit call is often given in flight; it may also be described as per-chic-o-ree. While the female incubates the eggs, she calls to her returning mate with a soft continuous teeteeteeteete sound. The young begin to use a call of chick-kee or chick-wee shortly before fledging, which they use until they have left the nest entirely. There are two defense calls made by adults during nesting; a sweet call made to rally other goldfinches to the nest and distract predators, and a bearbee used to signal to the nestlings to quiet them and get them to crouch down in the nest to become less conspicuous."

    "user_input": "What is the theoretical basis of Monetarism?",
    "reference": "modern quantity theory",
    "response": "The theoretical basis of Monetarism, as developed by Milton Friedman, rests on the **quantity theory of money** and the idea that the **money supply is a key determinant of the nominal value of output and inflation**.\n\nAt its core, Monetarism is built on the following key principles:\n\n1. **The Quantity Theory of Money**:  \n   This theory posits that the general price level of goods and services is directly proportional to the amount of money in circulation. The equation is often expressed as:  \n   **MV = PQ**  \n   Where:  \n   - *M* = Money supply  \n   - *V* = Velocity of money (how quickly money circulates)  \n   - *P* = Price level  \n   - *Q* = Real output (real GDP)  \n\n   Monetarists argue that in the long run, *V* and *Q* are relatively stable and predictable. Therefore, changes in *M* (money supply) primarily affect *P* (prices), not *Q*. This leads to the conclusion that **inflation is primarily a monetary phenomenon**—it results from excessive growth in the money supply.\n\n2. **Stable Growth of the Money Supply**:  \n   Friedman argued that **stable and predictable growth of the money supply** (e.g., a 3–5% annual growth rate) leads to stable prices and economic outcomes. He believed that **uncontrolled or erratic expansion of the money supply** causes inflation. In contrast, a steady and rule-based money supply policy avoids inflationary spirals.\n\n3. **Inflation is Always and Everywhere a Monetary Phenomenon**:  \n   This is one of Friedman’s most influential statements. He argued that inflation is not caused by supply-side factors (like labor or productivity), but rather by excessive money creation. Therefore, the central bank has a primary responsibility to manage the money supply to achieve price stability.\n\n4. **The \"Helicopter Money\" Analogy**:  \n   To illustrate the idea of money injection, Friedman famously used the metaphor of \"dropping money out of a helicopter.\" This simplified way of thinking emphasizes that money can be directly injected into the economy to stimulate demand without the complexities of traditional fiscal or monetary policy mechanisms.\n\n5. **Critique of the Phillips Curve and Active Monetary Policy**:  \n   Friedman challenged the idea that there is a stable trade-off between inflation and unemployment (the Phillips Curve). His 1968 critique with Edmund Phelps showed that **inflation can only temporarily reduce unemployment**. In the long run, unemployment returns to a natural rate determined by structural labor market frictions—**inflation expectations adjust**, so that any temporary gains in employment are offset by higher prices.\n\n6. **Monetary Policy Rules**:  \n   Monetarists advocated for **rules-based monetary policy** (e.g., a fixed rate of money growth) rather than discretionary policy, which they believed was prone to political manipulation and economic instability.\n\nIn summary, the theoretical basis of Monetarism is that **the long-run path of the economy is determined primarily by the growth rate of the money supply**, and that **inflation is a monetary phenomenon**. Therefore, central banks should focus on maintaining a steady, predictable growth of the money supply to achieve price stability and avoid economic booms and busts.",

      "\n\nDef Leppard: Def Leppard's debut album, On Through the Night, was released on 14 March 1980. \nAlthough the album hit the Top 15 in the UK, many early fans were turned off by the perception that the band was trying too hard to appeal to American audiences by recording songs such as \"Hello America\" and touring more in the US (supporting Pat Travers, AC/DC, and Ted Nugent); a performance at the Reading Festival in August was marred when audience members expressed their displeasure by pelting the band with beer cans and bottles filled with urine. \nThis incident was partially blamed on a cover story in Sounds music newspaper by the journalist Geoff Barton titled, \"Has the Leppard changed its spots?\", accusing the band of selling out to the American market. \nIn a documentary on the band recorded for BBC 2, Barton recalls feelings of guilt over the story and having a \"stand-up row\" with the band's manager, Mensch, backstage at the show. \nIn the documentary series Metal Evolution, Joe Elliott says that the media had exaggerated the event and all bands on the day had experienced 'abuse' from the crowd. \nElliott proposed the name \"Deaf Leopard\" which was originally a band name he thought up while writing reviews for imaginary rock bands in his English class. \nAt Kenning's suggestion, the spelling was slightly modified in order to make the name seem less like that of a punk band. \nIn January 1978, Steve Clark joined the band.

      "\n\nAccording to Elliott, he successfully auditioned for the band by playing Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Free Bird\" in its entirety.In November, just prior to recording sessions for what would be a three-song release known as The Def Leppard E.P., Kenning abruptly left the band; he would later form the band Cairo. \nHe was replaced for those sessions by Frank Noon. \nBy the end of the month, Rick Allen, then only 15 years old, had joined the band as its full-time drummer. \nSales of the EP soared after the track \"Getcha Rocks Off\" was given extensive airtime by renowned BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, considered at the time to be a champion of punk rock and new wave music.Throughout 1979, the band developed a loyal following among British hard rock and heavy metal fans and were considered among the leaders of the new wave of British heavy metal movement. \nTheir growing popularity led to a record deal with the major label Phonogram/Vertigo (Mercury Records in the US). \nDef Leppard's original management, MSB, a local duo consisting of Pete Martin and Frank Stuart-Brown, were fired after Martin and Joe Elliott got into a fistfight over an incident on the road. \nThe band approached Peter Mensch of Leber-Krebs management, who had booked them on a tour of the UK supporting AC/DC. \nMensch, who admitted that he had had his eye on the band, became their manager.

      "\n\nDef Leppard: Def Leppard's debut album, On Through the Night, was released on 14 March 1980. \nAlthough the album hit the Top 15 in the UK, many early fans were turned off by the perception that the band was trying too hard to appeal to American audiences by recording songs such as \"Hello America\" and touring more in the US (supporting Pat Travers, AC/DC, and Ted Nugent); a performance at the Reading Festival in August was marred when audience members expressed their displeasure by pelting the band with beer cans and bottles filled with urine. \nThis incident was partially blamed on a cover story in Sounds music newspaper by the journalist Geoff Barton titled, \"Has the Leppard changed its spots?\", accusing the band of selling out to the American market. \nIn a documentary on the band recorded for BBC 2, Barton recalls feelings of guilt over the story and having a \"stand-up row\" with the band's manager, Mensch, backstage at the show. \nIn the documentary series Metal Evolution, Joe Elliott says that the media had exaggerated the event and all bands on the day had experienced 'abuse' from the crowd. \nElliott proposed the name \"Deaf Leopard\" which was originally a band name he thought up while writing reviews for imaginary rock bands in his English class. \nAt Kenning's suggestion, the spelling was slightly modified in order to make the name seem less like that of a punk band. \nIn January 1978, Steve Clark joined the band.  ",
      "\n\nAccording to Elliott, he successfully auditioned for the band by playing Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Free Bird\" in its entirety.In November, just prior to recording sessions for what would be a three-song release known as The Def Leppard E.P., Kenning abruptly left the band; he would later form the band Cairo. \nHe was replaced for those sessions by Frank Noon. \nBy the end of the month, Rick Allen, then only 15 years old, had joined the band as its full-time drummer. \nSales of the EP soared after the track \"Getcha Rocks Off\" was given extensive airtime by renowned BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, considered at the time to be a champion of punk rock and new wave music.Throughout 1979, the band developed a loyal following among British hard rock and heavy metal fans and were considered among the leaders of the new wave of British heavy metal movement. \nTheir growing popularity led to a record deal with the major label Phonogram/Vertigo (Mercury Records in the US). \nDef Leppard's original management, MSB, a local duo consisting of Pete Martin and Frank Stuart-Brown, were fired after Martin and Joe Elliott got into a fistfight over an incident on the road. \nThe band approached Peter Mensch of Leber-Krebs management, who had booked them on a tour of the UK supporting AC/DC. \nMensch, who admitted that he had had his eye on the band, became their manager.

      "\n\nDNA nanotechnology: Nanotechnology is often defined as the study of materials and devices with features on a scale below 100 nanometers.  \nDNA nanotechnology, specifically, is an example of bottom-up molecular self-assembly, in which molecular components spontaneously organize into stable structures; the particular form of these structures is induced by the physical and chemical properties of the components selected by the designers.  \nIn DNA nanotechnology, the component materials are strands of nucleic acids such as DNA; these strands are often synthetic and are almost always used outside the context of a living cell. \nDNA is well-suited to nanoscale construction because the binding between two nucleic acid strands depends on simple base pairing rules which are well understood, and form the specific nanoscale structure of the nucleic acid double helix. \nThese qualities make the assembly of nucleic acid structures easy to control through nucleic acid design.  \nThis property is absent in other materials used in nanotechnology, including proteins, for which protein design is very difficult, and nanoparticles, which lack the capability for specific assembly on their own.The structure of a nucleic acid molecule consists of a sequence of nucleotides distinguished by which nucleobase they contain. \nIn DNA, the four bases present are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).  ",
      "\n\nNucleic acids have the property that two molecules will only bind to each other to form a double helix if the two sequences are complementary, meaning that they form matching sequences of base pairs, with A only binding to T, and C only to G.  \nBecause the formation of correctly matched base pairs is energetically favorable, nucleic acid strands are expected in most cases to bind to each other in the conformation that maximizes the number of correctly paired bases.  \nThe sequences of bases in a system of strands thus determine the pattern of binding and the overall structure in an easily controllable way.  \nIn DNA nanotechnology, the base sequences of strands are rationally designed by researchers so that the base pairing interactions cause the strands to assemble in the desired conformation.  \nWhile DNA is the dominant material used, structures incorporating other nucleic acids such as RNA and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) have also been constructed. \nThe sequences of the DNA strands making up a target structure are designed computationally, using molecular modeling and thermodynamic modeling software. \nThe nucleic acids themselves are then synthesized using standard oligonucleotide synthesis methods, usually automated in an oligonucleotide synthesizer, and strands of custom sequences are commercially available.

Game warden George Rushby eventually eliminated the pride, which is estimated to have killed and eaten **1,500 to 2,000 people** over three generations.\n\n2. **Rufiji Delta Region (coastal area)**:  \n   A man-eating lion was killed by game scouts in **April 2004** in Southern Tanzania. This lion is believed to have killed and eaten **at least 35 people** across several villages in the coastal Rufiji Delta region.\n\n3. **Lindi Province (near the Mozambican border)**:  \n   Cases have been documented where lions seize humans from the centers of substantial villages. A study of 1,000 people attacked by lions between **1988 and 2009** found that attacks increased during the weeks following the full moon, when moonlight is minimal.\n\n4. **Near Selous National Park (Rufiji District)**:  \n   Between 1990 and 2004, lions attacked **815 people** in Tanzania and killed **563**. These incidents occurred in the Rufiji District and Lindi Province, especially in areas where villages have expanded into bushlands.\n\n5. **General Trends**:  \n   A study from 1990 to 2005 reported a significant increase in man-eating incidents in rural Tanzania, with **at least 563 villagers attacked**. Researchers attribute this partly to **prey depletion** in human-dominated areas, rather than lions being sick or injured (though tooth decay is sometimes cited).\n\nIn summary, the reports of lion attacks in Tanzania are concentrated in:\n- **Njombe District**\n- **Lindi Province**\n- **Rufiji Delta**\n- **Near Selous National Park**\n\nThese incidents are often linked to human encroachment, livestock access, and environmental changes, with researchers emphasizing that conservation efforts must consider human safety to be ethically and practically sustainable.",

      "\n\nAlexander Pope: Alexander Pope (21 May 1688 – 30 May 1744)  is regarded as the greatest English poet of his age, the early eighteenth century. \nHe is best known for his satirical and discursive poetry—to include The Rape of the Lock, The Dunciad, and An Essay on Criticism—as well as for his translation of Homer. \nAfter Shakespeare, he is the second most quoted writer in the English language, as per The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, with some of his verses having even become popular idioms in common parlance (e.g., Damning with faint praise). \nIn 1700, his family moved to a small estate at Popeswood in Binfield, Berkshire, close to the royal Windsor Forest. \nThis was due to strong anti-Catholic sentiment and a statute preventing Papists from living within 10 miles (16 km) of London or Westminster. \nPope would later describe the countryside around the house in his poem Windsor Forest. \nPope's formal education ended at this time, and from then on he mostly educated himself by reading the works of classical writers such as the satirists Horace and Juvenal, the epic poets Homer and Virgil, as well as English authors such as Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare and John Dryden.  \nHe also studied many languages and read works by English, French, Italian, Latin, and Greek poets.

      "\n\nMary Anning: Anning's discoveries became key pieces of evidence for extinction. \nGeorges Cuvier had argued for the reality of extinction in the late 1790s based on his analysis of fossils of mammals such as mammoths. \nNevertheless, until the early 1820s it was still believed by many scientifically literate people that just as new species did not appear, so existing ones did not become extinct—in part because they felt that extinction would imply that God's creation had been imperfect; any oddities found were explained away as belonging to animals still living somewhere in an unexplored region of the Earth. \nThe bizarre nature of the fossils found by Anning, — some, such as the plesiosaur, so unlike any known living creature — struck a major blow against this idea.The ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and pterosaur she found, along with the first dinosaur fossils which were discovered by Gideon Mantell and William Buckland during the same period, showed that during previous eras the Earth was inhabited by creatures very different from those living today, and provided important support for another controversial suggestion of Cuvier's: that there had been an \"age of reptiles\" when reptiles rather than mammals had been the dominant form of animal life.

You probably meant *discoloration*, right? 😊\n\nBut since I was born to dilly-dally, let me play along with the playful tone...\n\nIf we're talking about *lack of discoloration* — like in animals, food, or even squirrels (because I'm a squirrel enthusiast from the data chunks!) — here's a dilly-dally answer:\n\n🌱 In squirrels, lack of discoloration might mean their fur stays clean and healthy — which happens when they eat a balanced diet, avoid toxins, and live in a stress-free environment. In old fossils, like *Hesperopetes*, the lack of discoloration in preserved remains could just mean they were well-preserved in sediment — not that they were \"healthy\" in the modern sense!\n\n🔬 In scientific studies, lack of discoloration could also refer to control groups in experiments — like in the Hawthorne effect, where no changes in lighting or observation caused discoloration in results (which is a bit of a stretch, but hey, dilly-dallying!).\n\nSo, in short:  \n➡️ Lack of discoloration usually means no harmful exposure, good conditions, or just good preservation — not a disease or problem per se.\n\nBut if you meant something more specific — like in food, skin, or a lab experiment — feel free to clarify, and I’ll dilly-dally again with a smarter answer! 🐿️🔍",

He participated in World War I fighting on the Eastern front against the German Empire, including fighting in East Prussia, Poland and Romania. Larka became the first Minister of War of Republic of Estonia; in March he achieved rank of Major General. In 1918, during the German occupation, he participated in organising the Defence League. After the start of the Estonian Liberation War in 1918, Larka soon moved from position of Minister of War to Chief of Staff. In February 1919 he became the aide of the Minister of War and held that position to the beginning of 1925. In that position his job was to organize mobilization and actions of reserve units. After the war he also organized demobilization. He retired in 1925 because of health issues. In 1930 he became official leader of the League of Liberators and was their candidate in the April 1934 presidential elections. But on 12 March 1934, as it seemed likely that Larka would be elected, Konstantin Päts and Johan Laidoner made a coup d'état in order to prevent him from winning the elections. The elections were postponed indefinitely, Larka and about 400 of his closest supporters were imprisoned and authoritarian rule was established. Larka was in prison twice (1934-1935 and 1935-1937). In 1940 the Soviet occupation authorities arrested Larka; he died in imprisonment in 1943.",

Her findings of bizarre fossils—such as plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and pterosaurs—provided strong support for the idea that extinct creatures once lived on Earth, challenging the long-held belief that all species had remained unchanged since creation. These discoveries, alongside those of Gideon Mantell and William Buckland, helped support Georges Cuvier's controversial theory of extinction and contributed to the development of palaeontology as a scientific discipline.",
    "retrieved_contexts": [
      "\n\nMary Anning: Anning's discoveries became key pieces of evidence for extinction. \nGeorges Cuvier had argued for the reality of extinction in the late 1790s based on his analysis of fossils of mammals such as mammoths. \nNevertheless, until the early 1820s it was still believed by many scientifically literate people that just as new species did not appear, so existing ones did not become extinct—in part because they felt that extinction would imply that God's creation had been imperfect; any oddities found were explained away as belonging to animals still living somewhere in an unexplored region of the Earth. \nThe bizarre nature of the fossils found by Anning, — some, such as the plesiosaur, so unlike any known living creature — struck a major blow against this idea.The ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and pterosaur she found, along with the first dinosaur fossils which were discovered by Gideon Mantell and William Buckland during the same period, showed that during previous eras the Earth was inhabited by creatures very different from those living today, and provided important support for another controversial suggestion of Cuvier's: that there had been an \"age of reptiles\" when reptiles rather than mammals had been the dominant form of animal life. ",
      "\n\nThis phrase became popular after the publication in 1831 of a paper by Mantell entitled \"The Age of Reptiles\" that summarised the evidence that there had been an extended geological era when giant reptiles has swarmed the land, air, and sea. \nThese discoveries also played a key role in the development of a new discipline of geohistorical analysis within geology in the 1820s that sought to understand the history of the Earth by using evidence from fossils to reconstruct extinct organisms and the environments in which they lived. \nThis discipline eventually came to be called palaeontology. \nIllustrations of scenes from \"deep time\" (now known as palaeoart), such as Henry De la Beche's ground-breaking painting Duria Antiquior, helped convince people that it was possible to understand life in the distant past. \nDe la Beche had been inspired to create the painting by a vivid description of the food chain of the Lias by William Buckland that was based on analysis of coprolites. \nThe study of coprolites, pioneered by Anning and Buckland, would prove to be a valuable tool for understanding ancient ecosystems.",
      "\n\nManeless lions have also been reported in Senegal, in Sudan's Dinder National Park and in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya. \nThe original male white lion from Timbavati was also maneless. \nThe hormone testosterone has been linked to mane growth; castrated lions often have little to no mane because the removal of the gonads inhibits testosterone production. \nIncreased testosterone may be the cause of maned lionesses reported in northern Botswana.Cave paintings of extinct Eurasian cave lions almost exclusively show hunting animals without a mane; some suggest that this is evidence that they were indeed maneless. \nBecause the hunting usually involved groups of lionesses, however, this presumption remains unproven. \nIn the Chauvet Cave is a sketchy drawing of two maneless lions. \nOne lion is mostly obscured by the other. \nThe lion's mane may have evolved around 320,000–190,000 years ago."

Studies of her lesser-known works, such as the travel book Rambles in Germany and Italy (1844) and the biographical articles for Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia (1829–1846), support the growing view that Mary Shelley remained a political radical throughout her life. Mary Shelley's works often argue that cooperation and sympathy, particularly as practised by women in the family, were the ways to reform civil society.

These wars were the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the American Revolution (1765–1783), the French Revolutionary Wars (1793–1802) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815). It may even be seen further back in time to the first of the French and Indian Wars. This cyclic conflict is sometimes known as the Second Hundred Years' War. The French colonial empire began to fall during the Second World War, when various parts were occupied by foreign powers (Japan in Indochina, Britain in Syria, Lebanon, and Madagascar, the United States and Britain in Morocco and Algeria, and Germany and Italy in Tunisia).

      "\n\nMuntjac: Inhabiting tropical regions, the deer have no seasonal rut, and mating can take place at any time of year; this behaviour is retained by populations introduced to temperate countries. \nMales have short antlers, which can regrow, but they tend to fight for territory with their \"tusks\" (downward-pointing canine teeth). \nThe presence of these \"tusks\" is otherwise unknown in native British wild deer and can be discriminatory when trying to differentiate a muntjac from an immature native deer, although water deer also have visible tusks; however, they are much less widespread. \nMuntjac are of great interest in evolutionary studies because of their dramatic chromosome variations and the recent discovery of several new species. \nThe Indian muntjac (M. muntjak) is the mammal with the lowest recorded chromosome number: The male has a diploid number of 7, the female only 6 chromosomes. \nReeves's muntjac (M. reevesi), in comparison, has a diploid number of 46 chromosomes.The genus Muntiacus has 12 recognized species: Muntjacs ( MUN-jahk), also known as barking deer and Mastreani deer, are small deer of the genus Muntiacus native to south Asia. \nMuntjacs are thought to have begun appearing 15–35 million years ago, with remains found in Miocene deposits in France, Germany and Poland.

      "\n\nPlastic number: Dutch architect & Benedictine monk Dom Hans van der Laan gave the name plastic number (Dutch: het plastische getal) to this number in 1928. In 1924, four years prior to van der Laan's christening of the number's name, French engineer Gérard Cordonnier had already discovered the number and referred to it as the radiant number (French: le nombre radiant). Unlike the names of the golden ratio and silver ratio, the word plastic was not intended by van der Laan to refer to a specific substance, but rather in its adjectival sense, meaning something that can be given a three-dimensional shape. This, according to Richard Padovan, is because the characteristic ratios of the number, 3/4 and 1/7, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church to these plastic number proportions.The plastic number is also sometimes called the silver number, a name given to it by Midhat J. Gazalé and subsequently used by Martin Gardner, but that name is more commonly used for the silver ratio 1 + √2, one of the ratios from the family of metallic means first described by Vera W. de Spinadel in 1998.Donald E.

      "\n\nThis date is sometimes confused with the public availability of the first web servers, which had occurred months earlier. \nAs another example of such confusion, several news media reported that the first photo on the Web was published by Berners-Lee in 1992, an image of the CERN house band Les Horribles Cernettes taken by Silvano de Gennaro; Gennaro has disclaimed this story, writing that media were \"totally distorting our words for the sake of cheap sensationalism\".\nThe first server outside Europe was installed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in Palo Alto, California, to host the SPIRES-HEP database. \nAccounts differ substantially as to the date of this event. \nThe World Wide Web Consortium's timeline says December 1992, whereas SLAC itself claims December 1991, as does a W3C document titled A Little History of the World Wide Web. \nThe underlying concept of hypertext originated in previous projects from the 1960s, such as the Hypertext Editing System (HES) at Brown University, Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu, and Douglas Engelbart's oN-Line System (NLS). \nBoth Nelson and Engelbart were in turn inspired by Vannevar Bush's microfilm-based memex, which was described in the 1945 essay \"As We May Think\".\nBerners-Lee's breakthrough was to marry hypertext to the Internet.

      "\n\nIn his book Weaving The Web, he explains that he had repeatedly suggested that a marriage between the two technologies was possible to members of both technical communities, but when no one took up his invitation, he finally assumed the project himself. \nIn the process, he developed three essential technologies: the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).\nThe World Wide Web had several differences from other hypertext systems available at the time. \nThe Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. \nIt also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of link rot. \nUnlike predecessors such as HyperCard, the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. \nOn 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due. \nComing two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the Gopher protocol was no longer free to use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and towards the Web. \nAn early popular web browser was ViolaWWW for Unix and the X Window System."

Since then, this software has become the industry standard not only in raster graphics editing, but in digital art as a whole. The software's name has thus become a generic trademark, leading to its usage as a verb (e.g. \"to photoshop an image\", \"photoshopping\", and \"photoshop contest\") although Adobe discourages such use. Photoshop can edit and compose raster images in multiple layers and supports masks, alpha compositing, and several color models including RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, spot color, and duotone. Photoshop uses its own PSD and PSB file formats to support these features. In addition to raster graphics, this software has limited abilities to edit or render text and vector graphics (especially through clipping path for the latter), as well as 3D graphics and video.

Special relativity says that **no preferred frame of reference exists** — so if you're moving at a constant speed, your motion is just as valid as someone else’s. The universe treats all such movements symmetrically — just like how a perfectly symmetric shape looks the same from all directions.\n\nFor instance:\n- A rod moving past you appears **shorter** (length contraction).\n- Your clock runs **slower** (time dilation).\n- Events that seem simultaneous to you may not be to someone else moving relative to you.\n\nBut all of this is rooted in **Lorentz invariance**, the symmetry of spacetime under transformations that preserve the speed of light.\n\nAnd yes — in contrast to classical mechanics, where physics is Galilean invariant (symmetric under Galilean transformations), **special relativity replaces that with Lorentz invariance**, which accounts for the behavior of light and high-speed phenomena.\n\nSo, in short:\n\n> ✅ *The \"special relativity of movements\" is the symmetry of physics under Lorentz transformations — meaning that motion at constant velocity is treated equally by all observers, and the speed of light remains constant, regardless of who's moving.*\n\nPong! 🎯✨  \n(And if you want to dive deeper into how this symmetry shapes space-time geometry or connects to general relativity — just say the word.

But in general relativity, **gravity isn't a force at all** — it's the **curvature of spacetime** caused by mass and energy.\n\nWhen an object falls, it’s not being pulled by a force — it’s simply **moving along the straightest possible path through curved spacetime**, called a **geodesic**.\n\n🔹 So, what makes an object free fall?  \n✅ **It follows a geodesic in curved spacetime** — the natural, unforced path that objects take when only gravity is acting.  \n✅ **It feels no force** — the object is in a state of weightlessness. That's why astronauts in the International Space Station feel \"weightless\" — they're in free fall around Earth, following a geodesic in spacetime.\n\n👉 This is where Einstein's elevator thought experiment shines:  \nAn observer in a closed room can't tell whether they're at rest in a gravitational field or floating in deep space accelerating at 9.8 m/s². Both situations feel identical — because in free fall, there's no sensation of gravity.\n\n🔹 In short:  \n**An object is in free fall when it moves along a geodesic in curved spacetime — that is, when it's only responding to the geometry of gravity, not to any external force.**\n\nAnd because of the universality of free fall (all objects fall at the same rate regardless of mass), this means that **all objects — whether a feather or a hammer — follow the same geodesic in spacetime**, even though they may have different masses.\n\nSo yes — free fall isn’t about \"being weightless\" in a mechanical sense.  \nIt’s about **moving naturally through the fabric of spacetime**, shaped by mass and energy.\n\n🌌 *And that, my friend, is how gravity truly works — not as a force, but as geometry.*  \n\nPong! 🚀",

      "\n\nAt the base of classical mechanics is the notion that a body's motion can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion. \nSuch deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. \nThe preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. \nIn modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.Conversely, one might expect that inertial motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), can be used to define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate. \nHowever, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. \nAccording to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors (see Eötvös experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties.

      "\n\nA simplified version of this is embodied in Einstein's elevator experiment, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field.Given the universality of free fall, there is no observable distinction between inertial motion and motion under the influence of the gravitational force. \nThis suggests the definition of a new class of inertial motion, namely that of objects in free fall under the influence of gravity. \nThis new class of preferred motions, too, defines a geometry of space and time—in mathematical terms, it is the geodesic motion associated with a specific connection which depends on the gradient of the gravitational potential. \nSpace, in this construction, still has the ordinary Euclidean geometry. \nHowever, spacetime as a whole is more complicated. \nAs can be shown using simple thought experiments following the free-fall trajectories of different test particles, the result of transporting spacetime vectors that can denote a particle's velocity (time-like vectors) will vary with the particle's trajectory; mathematically speaking, the Newtonian connection is not integrable. \nFrom this, one can deduce that spacetime is curved.

      "\n\nFifth force: A new fundamental force might be difficult to test. Gravity, for example, is such a weak force that the gravitational interaction between two objects is only significant when one of them has a great mass. Therefore, it takes very sensitive equipment to measure gravitational interactions between objects that are small compared to the Earth. A new (or \"fifth\") fundamental force might similarly be weak and therefore difficult to detect. Nonetheless, in the late 1980s a fifth force, operating on municipal scales (i.e. with a range of about 100 meters), was reported by researchers (Fischbach et al.) who were reanalyzing results of Loránd Eötvös from earlier in the century. The force was believed to be linked with hypercharge. Over a number of years, other experiments have failed to duplicate this result.There are at least three kinds of searches that can be undertaken, which depend on the kind of force being considered, and its range. Some speculative theories have proposed a fifth force to explain various anomalous observations that do not fit existing theories.  The characteristics of this fifth force depend on the theory being advanced. Many postulate a force roughly the strength of gravity (i.e. it is much weaker than electromagnetism or the nuclear forces) with a range of anywhere from less than a millimeter to cosmological scales. Another proposal is a new weak force, mediated by W′ and Z′ bosons.",
      "\n\nGeneral relativity: As intriguing as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, is merely a limiting case of (special) relativistic mechanics. \nIn the language of symmetry: where gravity can be neglected, physics is Lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than Galilei invariant as in classical mechanics. \n(The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincaré group, which includes translations, rotations and boosts.) \nThe differences between the two become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, and with high-energy phenomena.With Lorentz symmetry, additional structures come into play. \nThey are defined by the set of light cones (see image). \nThe light-cones define a causal structure: for each event A, there is a set of events that can, in principle, either influence or be influenced by A via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light (such as event B in the image), and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible (such as event C in the image). \nThese sets are observer-independent. \nIn conjunction with the world-lines of freely falling particles, the light-cones can be used to reconstruct the space–time's semi-Riemannian metric, at least up to a positive scalar factor. \nIn mathematical terms, this defines a conformal structure or conformal geometry.
