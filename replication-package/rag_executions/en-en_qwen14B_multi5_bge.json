      "\n\nPappataci fever: Pappataci fever is prevalent in the subtropical zone of the Eastern Hemisphere between 20°N and 45°N, particularly in Southern Europe, North Africa, the Balkans, Eastern Mediterranean, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and India.The disease is transmitted by the bites of phlebotomine sandflies of the Genus Phlebotomus, in particular, Phlebotomus papatasi, Phlebotomus perniciosus and Phlebotomus perfiliewi. The sandfly becomes infected when biting an infected human in the period between 48 hours before the onset of fever and 24 hours after the end of the fever, and remains infected for its lifetime. Besides this horizontal virus transmission from man to sandfly, the virus can be transmitted in insects transovarially, from an infected female sandfly to its offspring.Pappataci fever is seldom recognised in endemic populations because it is mixed with other febrile illnesses of childhood, but it is more well-known among immigrants and military personnel from non-endemic regions.",
      "\n\nMycobacterium marinum: Although Aronson isolated this mycobacterium in 1926 from a fish, it was not until 1951 that it was found to be the cause of human disease by Linell and Norden. Large outbreaks of infection due to this atypical mycobacterium have been described in association with swimming. Infections related to swimming pools have now drastically fallen due to the improvements in the construction and maintenance of these facilities.The first case of M. marinum infection associated with a fish-tank ('fish-tank granuloma') was reported in 1962 by Swift and Cohen. M. marinum infection may be an occupational hazard for certain professions such as pet shop workers, but most infections occur in fish fanciers who keep an aquarium at home. Although infection may be caused by direct injury from the fish fins or bites, most are acquired during the handling of the aquariums such as cleaning or changing the water. Indirect infection has also been described related to a child’s bathing utensils that had been used to clean a fish tank. Due to an increased awareness of the disease and improved isolation methods, more and more cases are being recognized and reported worldwide.",

    "response": "The dysfunction of small blood vessels (microvascular damage) plays a **central role in the pathogenesis and progression of diabetic neuropathy**, as highlighted in the context. Here's why it is critically important:\n\n### 1. **Early Onset and Parallel Progression**  \n   - Small blood vessel dysfunction occurs **early in diabetes** and **parallels the progression of neural dysfunction**. This suggests that vascular impairment is not merely a secondary effect but a **primary contributor** to nerve damage.  \n   - For example, narrowing of small blood vessels reduces blood flow to nerves, leading to **ischemia (lack of oxygen)** and subsequent nerve dysfunction.\n\n### 2. **Structural and Functional Changes in Nerves**  \n   - Vascular abnormalities (e.g., **capillary basement membrane thickening**, **endothelial hyperplasia**) directly impair oxygen delivery to nerves, causing **hypoxia** and **metabolic stress**. This disrupts nerve function and contributes to the **clinical manifestations** of diabetic neuropathy (e.g., loss of sensation, muscle weakness, autonomic dysfunction).  \n   - The context notes that these vascular changes are **closely correlated** with neuronal dysfunction, emphasizing their role in the disease's severity.\n\n### 3. **Link to Glycemic Control**  \n   - The progression of neuropathy is tied to **glycemic control**. Poor blood sugar management exacerbates vascular damage, which in turn worsens neuropathy. Intensive treatment (as shown in the DCCT study) reduces neuropathy incidence, underscoring the interplay between vascular health and nerve function.\n\n### 4. **Bidirectional Relationship Between Vascular and Neural Disease**  \n   - Nerves and blood vessels are **interdependent**:  \n     - **Nerves regulate blood flow** (e.g., autonomic nerves control vascular tone).  \n     - **Blood vessels supply oxygen and nutrients to nerves**.  \n   - Dysfunction in one system exacerbates damage to the other, creating a **vicious cycle** that worsens diabetic neuropathy.\n\n### 5. **Therapeutic Implications**  \n   - Treatments targeting vascular function (e.g., **ACE inhibitors**, **α1-antagonists**) improve neuronal blood flow and nerve conduction velocities, highlighting the **clinical relevance** of addressing vascular dysfunction in managing neuropathy.\n\n### Summary  \nSmall blood vessel dysfunction is a **key driver** of diabetic neuropathy, contributing to nerve ischemia, hypoxia, and structural/functional nerve damage.

      "\n\nA pins and needles sensation is common. \nLoss of proprioception, the sense of where a limb is in space, is affected early. \nThese patients cannot feel when they are stepping on a foreign body, like a splinter, or when they are developing a callous from an ill-fitting shoe. \nConsequently, they are at risk of developing ulcers and infections on the feet and legs, which can lead to amputation. \nSimilarly, these patients can get multiple fractures of the knee, ankle or foot, and develop a Charcot joint. \nLoss of motor function results in dorsiflexion, contractures of the toes, loss of the interosseous muscle function that leads to contraction of the digits, so-called hammer toes. \nThese contractures occur not only in the foot but also in the hand where the loss of the musculature makes the hand appear gaunt and skeletal. \nThe loss of muscular function is progressive. \nThe autonomic nervous system is composed of nerves serving the heart, lungs, blood vessels, bone, adipose tissue, sweat glands, gastrointestinal system and genitourinary system. \nAutonomic neuropathy can affect any of these organ systems. \nThe most commonly recognized autonomic dysfunction in diabetics is orthostatic hypotension, or becoming dizzy and possibly fainting when standing up due to a sudden drop in blood pressure. ",
      "\n\nDiabetic neuropathy: Diabetic neuropathy affects all peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, but rarely affects the autonomic nervous system.  \nTherefore, diabetic neuropathy can affect all organs and systems, as all are innervated. \nThere are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems and members affected, but these are by no means exclusive. \nA patient can have sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy or any other combination. \nSigns and symptoms vary depending on the nerve(s) affected and may include symptoms other than those listed. \nSymptoms usually develop gradually over years. \nGlobally diabetic neuropathy affects approximately 132 million people as of 2010 (1.9% of the population).\nDiabetes is the leading known cause of neuropathy in developed countries, and neuropathy is the most common complication and greatest source of morbidity and mortality in diabetes. \nIt is estimated that neuropathy affects 25% of people with diabetes. \nDiabetic neuropathy is implicated in 50–75% of nontraumatic amputations. \nLonger nerve fibers are affected to a greater degree than shorter ones because nerve conduction velocity is slowed in proportion to a nerve's length. \nIn this syndrome, decreased sensation and loss of reflexes occurs first in the toes on each foot, then extends upward. \nIt is usually described as a glove-stocking distribution of numbness, sensory loss, dysesthesia and night time pain. \nThe pain can feel like burning, pricking sensation, achy or dull.

    "user_input": "what is the process by which one element is changed into another?",
    "reference": "transmutation",
    "response": "The process of changing one element into another is called **nuclear transmutation**. Historically, alchemists (like those mentioned in the context of the Philosopher's Stone) believed in transforming metals through mystical or chemical means, but their theories were based on the idea of rearranging \"qualities\" (e.g., hot, cold, moist, dry) rather than actual atomic changes. However, modern science explains element transmutation through **nuclear reactions**, which alter the number of protons in an atom's nucleus:\n\n1. **Nuclear Reactions**:  \n   - Elements can be transmuted by bombarding atomic nuclei with particles (e.g., protons, neutrons, or alpha particles) in devices like **particle accelerators** or **reactors**. For example:  \n     - Bombarding uranium-238 with neutrons can eventually produce plutonium-239.  \n     - In stars (like those in the Milky Way), fusion processes convert lighter elements (e.g., hydrogen) into heavier ones (e.g., helium, carbon) through nuclear fusion.  \n\n2. **Radioactive Decay**:  \n   - Unstable isotopes decay over time, transforming into different elements. For instance:  \n     - Uranium-238 decays into lead-206 through a series of alpha and beta decays.  \n\n3. **Artificial Transmutation**:  \n   - Scientists can artificially create new elements (e.g., superheavy elements like oganesson) by colliding heavy nuclei in particle accelerators, altering the number of protons in the nucleus.  \n\nWhile alchemists sought to turn base metals into gold (a goal tied to the Philosopher's Stone), modern transmutation is used in research, medicine (e.g., producing isotopes for cancer treatment), and energy production (e.g., nuclear reactors). The key difference is that alchemy relied on speculative theories, whereas nuclear transmutation is grounded in quantum physics and experimental science.",

      "\n\nA leading opponent was the Persian polymath Avicenna (Ibn Sina), who discredited the theory of transmutation of substances, stating, \"Those of the chemical craft know well that no change can be effected in the different species of substances, though they can produce the appearance of such change.\"\nAccording to legend, the 13th-century scientist and philosopher Albertus Magnus is said to have discovered the philosopher's stone. \nMagnus does not confirm he discovered the stone in his writings, but he did record that he witnessed the creation of gold by \"transmutation\". \nThe earliest known written mention of the philosopher's stone is in the Cheirokmeta by Zosimos of Panopolis (c. \n300 AD). \nAlchemical writers assign a longer history. \nElias Ashmole and the anonymous author of Gloria Mundi (1620) claim that its history goes back to Adam who acquired the knowledge of the stone directly from God. \nThis knowledge was said to be passed down through biblical patriarchs, giving them their longevity. \nThe legend of the stone was also compared to the biblical history of the Temple of Solomon and the rejected cornerstone described in Psalm 118.\nThe theoretical roots outlining the stone’s creation can be traced to Greek philosophy. \nAlchemists later used the classical elements, the concept of anima mundi, and Creation stories presented in texts like Plato's Timaeus as analogies for their process. ",
      "\n\nAccording to Plato, the four elements are derived from a common source or prima materia (first matter), associated with chaos. \nPrima materia is also the name alchemists assign to the starting ingredient for the creation of the philosopher's stone. \nThe importance of this philosophical first matter persisted throughout the history of alchemy. \nIn the seventeenth century, Thomas Vaughan writes, \"the first matter of the stone is the very same with the first matter of all things\". \nThe philosopher's stone, more properly philosophers' stone or stone of the philosophers (Latin: lapis philosophorum) is a legendary alchemical substance capable of turning base metals such as mercury into gold (chrysopoeia, from the Greek χρυσός khrusos, \"gold\", and ποιεῖν poiēin, \"to make\") or silver. \nIt is also called the elixir of life, useful for rejuvenation and for achieving immortality; for many centuries, it was the most sought goal in alchemy. \nThe philosopher's stone was the central symbol of the mystical terminology of alchemy, symbolizing perfection at its finest, enlightenment, and heavenly bliss. \nEfforts to discover the philosopher's stone were known as the Magnum Opus (\"Great Work\").",
      "\n\nPhilosopher's stone: Early medieval alchemists built upon the work of Zosimos in the Byzantine Empire and the Arab empires. \nByzantine and Arab alchemists were fascinated by the concept of metal transmutation and attempted to carry out the process. \nThe 8th-century Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan (Latinized as Geber) analyzed each classical element in terms of the four basic qualities. \nFire was both hot and dry, earth cold and dry, water cold and moist, and air hot and moist. \nHe theorized that every metal was a combination of these four principles, two of them interior and two exterior. \nFrom this premise, it was reasoned that the transmutation of one metal into another could be affected by the rearrangement of its basic qualities. \nThis change would be mediated by a substance, which came to be called xerion in Greek and al-iksir in Arabic (from which the word elixir is derived). \nIt was often considered to exist as a dry red powder (also known as al-kibrit al-ahmar, red sulfur) made from a legendary stone—the philosopher's stone. \nThe elixir powder came to be regarded as a crucial component of transmutation by later Arab alchemists.In the 11th century, there was a debate among Muslim world chemists on whether the transmutation of substances was possible.

It was built first in 1800 by Sultan Selim III for the soldiers of the newly established  Nizam-ı Cedid (literally \"New Order\") in frame of the Ottoman military reform efforts. The initially wooden barracks was designed by Krikor Balyan. It was burnt down in 1806 by revolting Janissaries, who were against the reforms. Ordered by Sultan Mahmud II, rebuilding of the barracks in stone began in 1825 and it was completed on 6 February 1828. It is a gigantic rectangle building 200 m × 267 m (656 ft × 876 ft) with a large parade ground in the centre. The structure has three floors on three wings and two floors only on the eastern wing due to inclined terrain. During the reign of Sultan Abdülmecid I, the barracks were renovated twice, first in 1842–43 and again in 1849–50. During this process, a tower seven stories in height was added to each of the four corners, giving the barracks the look they have today.",

Mahmut Celâl Bayar (16 May 1883 – 22 August 1986) was a Turkish politician, who was the third President of Turkey from 1950 to 1960; previously he was Prime Minister of Turkey from 1937 to 1939. Bayar, as the Turkish President, was decorated with the Legion of Merit by the President of the United States, as a result of Turkey's participation in the Korean War. He is considered to be the longest-lived former head of state and was the longest-lived state leader until 8 December 2008 (when he was surpassed by Chau Sen Cocsal Chhum). Celal Bayar died on 22 August 1986 at the age of 103 after a brief illness. On 1 November 1937 Mustafa Kemal Atatürk appointed Bayar as Prime Minister of the 9th Government of Turkey after İsmet İnönü left the government. He continued to serve as prime minister when Atatürk died and İnönü became president in 1938 (10th government of Turkey). Differences of opinion with Inönü led him to resign from the position on 25 January 1939."

A tie for second in the men's Super G skiing competition meant that a pair of silver medals were given out, so no bronze medal was awarded for that event. In the four-man bobsleigh, a tie for third resulted in the awarding of two bronze medals. Due to these ties, the number of gold medals awarded was one more than the number of silver or bronze medals. In snowboarding, Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the gold medal in the men's Giant Slalom, but it was briefly stripped by the IOC after he tested positive for marijuana. After the Canadian Olympic Association filed an appeal, however, the IOC's decision was overturned. The medal table is based on information provided by the IOC and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won; a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee.

      "\n\nEver more precise solar system tests confirmed the theory's predictive power, and relativistic cosmology, too, became amenable to direct observational tests.Over the years, general relativity has acquired a reputation as a theory of extraordinary beauty. \nSubrahmanyan Chandrasekhar has noted that at multiple levels, general relativity exhibits what Francis Bacon has termed, a \"strangeness in the proportion\" (i.e. elements that excite wonderment and surprise). \nIt juxtaposes fundamental concepts (space and time versus matter and motion) which had previously been considered as entirely independent. \nChandrasekhar also noted that Einstein's only guides in his search for an exact theory were the principle of equivalence and his sense that a proper description of gravity should be geometrical at its basis, so that there was an \"element of revelation\" in the manner in which Einstein arrived at his theory. \nOther elements of beauty associated with the general theory of relativity are its simplicity, symmetry, the manner in which it incorporates invariance and unification, and its perfect logical consistency. \nThe notion of evolution equations is intimately tied in with another aspect of general relativistic physics. \nIn Einstein's theory, it turns out to be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy).

A new line of computers by the same name was released in 2015, serving the same purpose as an entry-level laptop. It replaced the iBook series and 12-inch PowerBook series of notebooks as a part of Apple's transition from PowerPC to Intel processors. Positioned as the low end of the MacBook family, below the premium ultra-portable MacBook Air and the powerful MacBook Pro,  the MacBook was aimed at the consumer and education markets.  It was the best-selling Macintosh ever. For five months in 2008, it was the best-selling laptop of any brand in US retail stores.  Collectively, the MacBook brand is the \"world's top-selling line of premium laptops.\"There have been four separate designs of the MacBook. The original model used a combination of polycarbonate and fiberglass casing which was modeled after the iBook G4. The second type was introduced in October 2008 alongside the 15-inch MacBook Pro; the MacBook shared the more expensive laptop's unibody aluminium casing, but omitted FireWire.

      "\n\nFrederick welcomed the creation of the North German Confederation, which joined Prussia and some Germanic principalities, because he saw that it was the first step toward German unification. \nHowever, the Confederation was far from adopting the liberal ideas of the crown prince. \nDespite being democratically elected, the Reichstag did not have the same powers as a British Parliament. \nIn addition, local sovereigns were more interested in maintaining their prerogatives, and the new German constitution gave many powers to the now Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. \nLess enthusiastic than her husband, Vicky saw the North German Confederation as an extension of the Prussian political system she hated. \nNevertheless, she remained hopeful that this situation was temporary and that a united and liberal Germany could be created. \nAt 17 years old, Victoria had to perform many tedious official duties. \nAlmost every evening, she had to appear at formal dinners, theatrical performances or public receptions. \nIf foreign relatives of the Hohenzollerns were located in Berlin or Potsdam, her protocolary duties widened. \nSometimes she was forced to greet guests of the royal family at the station at 7:00 in the morning and be present at receptions past midnight.Upon the arrival of Victoria in Berlin, King Frederick William IV gave to Frederick and his wife an old wing of the Berlin Royal Palace. \nThe building was in very bad condition, and it did not even contain a bathtub. \nThe couple moved to the Kronprinzenpalais in November 1858.

The pollen is dry, has an unsculpted exine, is less than 40 nm in diameter, and is usually deposited within 1.5 m of its source. This central mound consists of tightly packed pistils in the centre, with a crown-like ring of stamens surrounding this, which gives the species its name. The flowers produce 200–300 seeds. The plants form hard black tubers as storage organs.Aside from its flowers resembling poppies, the red single wild form flowers resemble the flowers of the red single wild form of Ranunculus asiaticus.",

It commemorates the reunion of a cowherder and weaving maid separated by the Milky Way.  \n   - The modern commercial celebration of Valentine's Day (since the 1960s) is linked to Western traditions, though some cultures have adopted or adapted it.\n\n2. **Global Celebrations**:  \n   - **Philippines**: Called *Araw ng mga Puso* (Day of the Hearts), marked by increased flower prices and weddings.  \n   - **Brazil**: Celebrates *Dia dos Namorados* (Lovers' Day) on **June 12**, avoiding overlap with Carnival.  \n   - **Korea**: Involves exchanging chocolates (more so than in Japan) and other gifts.  \n   - **Romania**: Faces criticism for being \"superficial and commercial,\" leading to a revival of the traditional *Dragobete* festival (February 24).  \n   - **Finland/Estonia**: Known as *Ystävänpäivä*/*Sõbrapäev* (\"Friend's Day\"), focusing on friendships rather than romantic relationships.  \n\n3. **Criticism & Alternatives**:  \n   - Some countries (e.g., **Sweden**) do not widely celebrate it.  \n   - In **Brazil**, February 14 is avoided due to proximity to Carnival.  \n   - In **Colombia**, *Día del amor y la amistad* (Day of Love and Friendship) is celebrated in September.  \n\n4. **Commercial Aspects**:  \n   - A 2016 survey noted less than 50% of people planned to buy gifts for partners, highlighting its evolving role.  \n\nIn essence, Valentine's Day is a mix of romantic tradition, cultural adaptation, and commercial influence, with diverse local interpretations worldwide. 💌",

Larka became the first Minister of War of Republic of Estonia; in March he achieved rank of Major General. In 1918, during the German occupation, he participated in organising the Defence League. After the start of the Estonian Liberation War in 1918, Larka soon moved from position of Minister of War to Chief of Staff. In February 1919 he became the aide of the Minister of War and held that position to the beginning of 1925. In that position his job was to organize mobilization and actions of reserve units. After the war he also organized demobilization. He retired in 1925 because of health issues. In 1930 he became official leader of the League of Liberators and was their candidate in the April 1934 presidential elections. But on 12 March 1934, as it seemed likely that Larka would be elected, Konstantin Päts and Johan Laidoner made a coup d'état in order to prevent him from winning the elections. The elections were postponed indefinitely, Larka and about 400 of his closest supporters were imprisoned and authoritarian rule was established. Larka was in prison twice (1934-1935 and 1935-1937). In 1940 the Soviet occupation authorities arrested Larka; he died in imprisonment in 1943."

    "response": "Color originates from the interaction between light and matter, as explained by Newton's theory of color. When light (which is electromagnetic radiation) interacts with an object, the object absorbs certain wavelengths and reflects others. The reflected wavelengths determine the color we perceive. For example, a red apple reflects red light and absorbs other wavelengths. \n\nNewton demonstrated that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors, which can be separated using a prism. This shows that color is a property of light itself, not inherently generated by objects. However, the specific colors we see depend on how materials interact with light. \n\nAdditionally, humans perceive color through specialized cells in the retina (cones) that detect different wavelengths, translating them into the brain's interpretation of color. In nature, pigments (like those in cave paintings or dog coats) absorb and reflect light to create visible colors, but the fundamental source of color remains the interaction of light with matter. 🌈",

    "response": "Newton's idea of terrestrial gravity was rooted in his **universal law of gravitation**, which he formulated in the late 17th century. Key aspects include:\n\n1. **Inverse-Square Law**: Newton proposed that the gravitational force between two objects decreases with the square of the distance between them. This meant terrestrial gravity (e.g., the force pulling objects to Earth) follows the same mathematical relationship as the force keeping the Moon in orbit around Earth.\n\n2. **Unification of Terrestrial and Celestial Mechanics**: Newton demonstrated that the same gravitational force responsible for phenomena like falling apples on Earth also governs the motion of celestial bodies. He calculated that if gravity decreases as the inverse square of the distance, it could explain the Moon's orbital period, aligning closely with observations.\n\n3. **Universal Gravitation**: He extended this idea to all matter in the universe, naming it \"universal gravitation.\" This force acts between any two masses, regardless of their location, and is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.\n\n4. **Theological Context**: Newton himself pondered the implications of gravity, noting that while it explains *how* celestial bodies move, it does not explain *why* they were set in motion, a question he attributed to divine intervention (\"God governs all things...\").\n\nThis theory revolutionized physics by unifying Earthly and cosmic forces under a single framework, though it was later refined by Einstein's general relativity.",

      "\n\nThe resulting Newton–Cartan theory is a geometric formulation of Newtonian gravity using only covariant concepts, i.e. a description which is valid in any desired coordinate system. \nIn this geometric description, tidal effects—the relative acceleration of bodies in free fall—are related to the derivative of the connection, showing how the modified geometry is caused by the presence of mass. \nGeneral relativity (GR, also known as the general theory of relativity or GTR) is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and the current description of gravitation in modern physics. \nGeneral relativity generalizes special relativity and supersedes Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. \nIn particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. \nThe relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations. \nIn general relativity, no material body can catch up with or overtake a light pulse. \nNo influence from an event A can reach any other location X before light sent out at A to X. \nIn consequence, an exploration of all light worldlines (null geodesics) yields key information about the spacetime's causal structure.

      "\n\nIn 1665, he discovered the generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became calculus. \nSoon after Newton had obtained his BA degree in August 1665, the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the Great Plague. \nAlthough he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student, Newton's private studies at his home in Woolsthorpe over the subsequent two years saw the development of his theories on calculus, optics, and the law of gravitation. \nIt is known from his notebooks that Newton was grappling in the late 1660s with the idea that terrestrial gravity extends, in an inverse-square proportion, to the Moon; however it took him two decades to develop the full-fledged theory. \nThe question was not whether gravity existed, but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the Moon to its orbit. \nNewton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon's orbital period, and get good agreement. \nHe guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it \"universal gravitation\". \nJohn Conduitt, Newton's assistant at the Royal Mint and husband of Newton's niece, also described the event when he wrote about Newton's life: Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum.

      "\n\nIn adolescents, it has been proposed that hypertension and pre-hypertension are diagnosed and classified using the same criteria as in adults.The value of routine screening for hypertension in children over the age of 3 years is debated. \nIn 2004 the National High Blood Pressure Education Program recommended that children aged 3 years and older have blood pressure measurement at In people aged 18 years or older hypertension is defined as either a systolic or a diastolic blood pressure measurement consistently higher than an accepted normal value (this is above 129 or 139 mmHg systolic, 89 mmHg diastolic depending on the guideline). \nOther thresholds are used (135 mmHg systolic or 85 mmHg diastolic) if measurements are derived from 24-hour ambulatory or home monitoring. \nRecent international hypertension guidelines have also created categories below the hypertensive range to indicate a continuum of risk with higher blood pressures in the normal range. \nThe Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7) published in 2003 uses the term prehypertension for blood pressure in the range 120–139 mmHg systolic or 80–89 mmHg diastolic, while European Society of Hypertension Guidelines (2007) and British Hypertension Society (BHS) IV (2004) use optimal, normal and high normal categories to subdivide pressures below 140 mmHg systolic and 90 mmHg diastolic.

      "\n\nFifth force: A new fundamental force might be difficult to test. Gravity, for example, is such a weak force that the gravitational interaction between two objects is only significant when one of them has a great mass. Therefore, it takes very sensitive equipment to measure gravitational interactions between objects that are small compared to the Earth. A new (or \"fifth\") fundamental force might similarly be weak and therefore difficult to detect. Nonetheless, in the late 1980s a fifth force, operating on municipal scales (i.e. with a range of about 100 meters), was reported by researchers (Fischbach et al.) who were reanalyzing results of Loránd Eötvös from earlier in the century. The force was believed to be linked with hypercharge. Over a number of years, other experiments have failed to duplicate this result.There are at least three kinds of searches that can be undertaken, which depend on the kind of force being considered, and its range. Some speculative theories have proposed a fifth force to explain various anomalous observations that do not fit existing theories.  The characteristics of this fifth force depend on the theory being advanced. Many postulate a force roughly the strength of gravity (i.e. it is much weaker than electromagnetism or the nuclear forces) with a range of anywhere from less than a millimeter to cosmological scales. Another proposal is a new weak force, mediated by W′ and Z′ bosons.",

      "\n\nFrench colonial empire: In the middle of the 18th century, a series of colonial conflicts began between France and Britain, which ultimately resulted in the destruction of most of the first French colonial empire and the near-complete expulsion of France from the Americas. These wars were the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the American Revolution (1765–1783), the French Revolutionary Wars (1793–1802) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815). It may even be seen further back in time to the first of the French and Indian Wars. This cyclic conflict is sometimes known as the Second Hundred Years' War. The French colonial empire began to fall during the Second World War, when various parts were occupied by foreign powers (Japan in Indochina, Britain in Syria, Lebanon, and Madagascar, the United States and Britain in Morocco and Algeria, and Germany and Italy in Tunisia). However, control was gradually reestablished by Charles de Gaulle. The French Union, included in the Constitution of 1946, nominally replaced the former colonial empire, but officials in Paris remained in full control. The colonies were given local assemblies with only limited local power and budgets. There emerged a group of elites, known as evolués, who were natives of the overseas territories but lived in metropolitan France."

      "\n\nGeorge VI: 22 January 1901 – 9 November 1901: His Royal Highness Prince Albert of Cornwall and York George was born at York Cottage, on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria. \nHis father was Prince George, Duke of York (later King George V), the second and eldest-surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra). \nHis mother was the Duchess of York (later Queen Mary), the eldest child and only daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Teck.His birthday, 14 December 1895, was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather, Albert, Prince Consort. \nUncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been \"rather distressed\". \nTwo days later, he wrote again: \"I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her\". \nQueen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: \"I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good\". \nConsequently, he was baptised \"Albert Frederick Arthur George\" at St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham, three months later.

      "\n\nPope Caius: As pope, Caius decreed that before someone could assume the position of bishop, he must first be porter, lector, exorcist, acolyte, subdeacon, deacon, and priest. He also divided the districts of Rome among the deacons. During his pontificate, anti-Christian measures increased, although new churches were built and cemeteries were expanded. St Caius may not have been martyred: Diocletian’s persecution of Christians began in 303 AD, after Caius’ alleged death, and Diocletian was not immediately hostile to Christianity upon becoming emperor. Pope Caius (died 22 April 296), also called Gaius, was the Bishop of Rome from 17 December 283 to his death in 296. Christian tradition makes him a native of the Dalmatian city of Salona, today Solin near Split, the son of a man also named Caius, and a member of a noble family related to the Emperor Diocletian.Little information on Caius is available except that given by the Liber Pontificalis, which relies on a legendary account of the martyrdom of St. Susanna for its information. According to legend, Caius baptized the men and women who had been converted by Saint Tiburtius (who is venerated with St. Susanna) and Saint Castulus. His legend states that Caius took refuge in the catacombs of Rome and died a martyr."

      "\n\nThroughout Pitt's ministry, George supported many of Pitt's political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt's supporters in the House of Lords. \nDuring and after Pitt's ministry, George III was extremely popular in Britain. \nThe British people admired him for his piety, and for remaining faithful to his wife. \nHe was fond of his children, and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy in 1782 and 1783 respectively. \nNevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. \nThey were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning, and to lead lives of religious observance and virtue. \nWhen his children strayed from George's own principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed and disappointed.By this time George's health was deteriorating. \nHe had a mental illness, characterised by acute mania, which was possibly a symptom of the genetic disease porphyria, although this has been questioned. \nA study of samples of the King's hair published in 2005 revealed high levels of arsenic, a possible trigger for the disease. \nThe source of the arsenic is not known, but it could have been a component of medicines or cosmetics. \nThe King may have had a brief episode of disease in 1765, but a longer episode began in the summer of 1788. \nAt the end of the parliamentary session, he went to Cheltenham Spa to recuperate. ",
      "\n\nIt was the furthest he had ever been from London—just short of 100 miles (150 km)—but his condition worsened. \nIn November he became seriously deranged, sometimes speaking for many hours without pause, causing him to foam at the mouth and making his voice hoarse. \nGeorge would frequently repeat himself, and write sentences with over 400 words at a time, as well as his vocabulary becoming more complex, possible symptoms of bipolar disorder.  \nHis doctors were largely at a loss to explain his illness, and spurious stories about his condition spread, such as the claim that he shook hands with a tree in the mistaken belief that it was the King of Prussia. \nTreatment for mental illness was primitive by modern standards, and the King's doctors, who included Francis Willis, treated the King by forcibly restraining him until he was calm, or applying caustic poultices to draw out \"evil humours\".\nIn the reconvened Parliament, Fox and Pitt wrangled over the terms of a regency during the King's incapacity. \nWhile both agreed that it would be most reasonable for George III's eldest son and heir apparent, the Prince of Wales, to act as regent, to Pitt's consternation Fox suggested that it was the Prince of Wales's absolute right to act on his ill father's behalf with full powers. \nPitt, fearing he would be removed from office if the Prince of Wales were empowered, argued that it was for Parliament to nominate a regent, and wanted to restrict the regent's authority.

      "\n\nThe Proclamation Line did not bother the majority of settled farmers, but it was unpopular with a vocal minority and ultimately contributed to conflict between the colonists and the British government. \nWith the American colonists generally unburdened by British taxes, the government thought it appropriate for them to pay towards the defence of the colonies against native uprisings and the possibility of French incursions. \nThe central issue for the colonists was not the amount of taxes but whether Parliament could levy a tax without American approval, for there were no American seats in Parliament. \nThe Americans protested that like all Englishmen they had rights to \"no taxation without representation\". \nIn 1765, Grenville introduced the Stamp Act, which levied a stamp duty on every document in the British colonies in North America. \nSince newspapers were printed on stamped paper, those most affected by the introduction of the duty were the most effective at producing propaganda opposing the tax. \nMeanwhile, the King had become exasperated at Grenville's attempts to reduce the King's prerogatives, and tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade William Pitt the Elder to accept the office of Prime Minister. \nAfter a brief illness, which may have presaged his illnesses to come, George settled on Lord Rockingham to form a ministry, and dismissed Grenville. \nMeanwhile, George's health deteriorated. \nHe developed dementia, and became completely blind and increasingly deaf.

    "reference": "modern quantity theory",
    "response": "Monetarism, as developed by Milton Friedman and other economists, is rooted in the **quantity theory of money**, which posits a direct relationship between the money supply and the price level (and nominal output) in an economy. Its theoretical basis includes the following key ideas:\n\n1. **Quantity Theory of Money**:  \n   Monetarism emphasizes that changes in the money supply are the primary driver of inflation and economic fluctuations. Friedman revived this theory, arguing that **inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon**. He proposed that a stable growth rate of the money supply (e.g., 3–5% annually) could prevent inflation while supporting economic growth.\n\n2. **Money Supply as the Key Determinant**:  \n   Friedman contended that **monetary policy** (control of the money supply) is more influential than fiscal policy (government spending or taxation) in determining consumption, output, and prices. His empirical work suggested that short-term changes in the money supply primarily affect output, while long-term effects manifest as price-level changes.\n\n3. **Permanent Income Hypothesis**:  \n   Friedman’s work on consumer behavior argued that individuals base spending decisions on their **expected long-term (permanent) income** rather than current income. This implies that temporary changes in income (e.g., windfalls or tax cuts) are largely saved, reinforcing the idea that monetary policy should focus on stable, predictable growth in the money supply.\n\n4. **Critique of the Phillips Curve**:  \n   Monetarists, including Friedman and Edmund Phelps, challenged the idea that governments could permanently reduce unemployment through inflation. They introduced the concept of the **natural rate of unemployment**, arguing that while inflation might temporarily lower unemployment (if unexpected), in the long run, unemployment is determined by structural factors (e.g., labor market frictions), not monetary policy.\n\n5. **Monetary Rules vs. Discretion**:  \n   Monetarists advocated for **rules-based monetary policy** (e.g., fixed growth rates for the money supply) to avoid the inefficiencies and political biases of discretionary central banking. This contrasts with Keynesian approaches that emphasize active fiscal intervention.\n\nIn essence, Monetarism prioritizes **monetary stability** as the foundation for economic health, emphasizing the role of money supply control in curbing inflation and fostering sustainable growth. Friedman’s \"helicopter money\" analogy (dropping money to simplify models) underscores his focus on the direct impact of monetary injections on the economy.",

      "\n\nNucleic acids have the property that two molecules will only bind to each other to form a double helix if the two sequences are complementary, meaning that they form matching sequences of base pairs, with A only binding to T, and C only to G.  \nBecause the formation of correctly matched base pairs is energetically favorable, nucleic acid strands are expected in most cases to bind to each other in the conformation that maximizes the number of correctly paired bases.  \nThe sequences of bases in a system of strands thus determine the pattern of binding and the overall structure in an easily controllable way.  \nIn DNA nanotechnology, the base sequences of strands are rationally designed by researchers so that the base pairing interactions cause the strands to assemble in the desired conformation.  \nWhile DNA is the dominant material used, structures incorporating other nucleic acids such as RNA and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) have also been constructed. \nThe sequences of the DNA strands making up a target structure are designed computationally, using molecular modeling and thermodynamic modeling software. \nThe nucleic acids themselves are then synthesized using standard oligonucleotide synthesis methods, usually automated in an oligonucleotide synthesizer, and strands of custom sequences are commercially available.

      "\n\nNew York (state): New York had been inhabited by tribes of Algonquian and Iroquoian-speaking Native Americans for several hundred years by the time the earliest Europeans came to New York. \nFrench colonists and Jesuit missionaries arrived southward from Montreal for trade and proselytizing. \nIn 1609, the region was visited by Henry Hudson sailing for the Dutch East India Company. \nThe Dutch built Fort Nassau in 1614 at the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers, where the present-day capital of Albany later developed. \nThe Dutch soon also settled New Amsterdam and parts of the Hudson Valley, establishing the multicultural colony of New Netherland, a center of trade and immigration. \nEngland seized the colony from the Dutch in 1664. \nDuring the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), a group of colonists of the Province of New York attempted to take control of the British colony and eventually succeeded in establishing independence. \nIn the 19th century, New York's development of access to the interior beginning with the Erie Canal, gave it incomparable advantages over other regions of the U.S. east-coast and built its political and cultural ascendancy.Many landmarks in New York are well known, including four of the world's ten most-visited tourist attractions in 2013: Times Square, Central Park, Niagara Falls, and Grand Central Terminal.

      "\n\nReligion in North Korea: Christianity (Korean: 그리스도교; MR: Kurisudogyo) became very popular in northern Korea from the late 18th century to the 19th century. \nThe first Catholic missionaries arrived in 1794, a decade after the return of Yi Sung-hun, a diplomat who was the first baptised Korean in Beijing. \nHe established a grassroots lay Catholic movement in the peninsula. \nHowever, the writings of the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci, who was resident at the imperial court in Beijing, had been already brought to Korea from China in the 17th century. \nScholars of the Silhak (\"Practical Learning\"), were attracted to Catholic doctrines, and this was a key factor for the spread of the Catholic faith in the 1790s. \nThe penetration of Western ideas and Christianity in Korea became known as Seohak (\"Western Learning\"). \nA study of 1801 found that more than half of the families that had converted to Catholicism were linked to the Silhak school. \nLargely because converts refused to perform Confucian ancestral rituals, the Joseon government prohibited the proselytisation of Christianity. \nSome Catholics were executed during the early 19th century, but the restrictive law was not strictly enforced. \nIn ancient times, most Koreans believed in their indigenous religion socially guided by mu (shamans). \nBuddhism was introduced from the Chinese Former Qin state in 372 to the northern Korean state of Goguryeo, and developed into distinctive Korean forms.

    "response": "The unequal treatment of Paralympians compared to non-disabled Olympic athletes stems from several interconnected factors, with **funding disparities** being a central issue. Here's a breakdown of the key challenges:\n\n1. **Funding Gap**:  \n   Paralympic athletes often receive significantly less financial support than their Olympic counterparts. This includes lower sponsorships, fewer media opportunities, and limited access to high-quality training facilities and equipment. The lack of investment can hinder their ability to compete at the same level and gain visibility.\n\n2. **Historical Segregation**:  \n   While the Paralympics were created to provide a platform for athletes with disabilities, they have long been treated as a separate event from the Olympics. This segregation has perpetuated a perception of the Paralympics as secondary, leading to unequal prioritization in resources, media coverage, and public attention.\n\n3. **Societal Attitudes**:  \n   Cultural stigma and misconceptions about disability can influence how Paralympians are viewed. Despite efforts to promote inclusivity, stereotypes about athletic ability and \"inspiration porn\" (reducing athletes to their disabilities) can overshadow their achievements, limiting their recognition as equals.\n\n4. **Structural Barriers**:  \n   Even though the Paralympics are now a major global event, logistical and organizational challenges (e.g., venue accessibility, adaptive equipment standards) can create hurdles. Additionally, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has faced criticism for slow progress in addressing systemic inequalities.\n\n5. **Media and Commercialization**:  \n   The Olympics receive far more media coverage and commercial sponsorship, which reinforces the notion of superiority. Paralympians often lack the same branding opportunities, further widening the gap in visibility and resources.\n\n**Progress and Hope**:  \nEfforts are being made to bridge this gap, such as increased media coverage (e.g., the 2012 London Paralympics), advocacy by athletes, and the IPC’s push for greater integration. However, achieving true equality requires sustained investment, cultural shift, and policy changes to ensure Paralympians are valued equally as athletes, not just as symbols of inspiration.",

      "\n\nOni (video game): The events of Oni take place in or after the year 2032. The game world is a dystopia, an Earth so polluted that little of it remains habitable. To solve international economic crises, all nations have combined into a single entity, the World Coalition Government. The government is totalitarian, telling the populace that what are actually dangerously toxic regions are wilderness preserves, and uses its police forces, the Technological Crimes Task Force (TCTF), to suppress opposition. The player character, code-named Konoko (voiced by Amanda Winn-Lee), full name later given as Mai Hasegawa, begins the game working for the TCTF. Soon, she learns her employers have been keeping secrets about her past from her. She turns against them as she embarks on a quest of self-discovery. The player learns more about her family and origins while battling both the TCTF and its greatest enemy, the equally monolithic criminal organization called the Syndicate. In the game's climax, Konoko discovers a Syndicate plan to cause the Atmospheric Conversion Centers, air-treatment plants necessary to keep most of the world's population alive, to catastrophically malfunction. She is partially successful in thwarting the plot, saving a portion of humanity."

Her brothers had initially returned with a group of men, forcing her to go back with them, but she eventually fled again independently.\n\n2. **Coded Farewell**: Before this escape, Tubman sent a coded message to her mother, singing a farewell song: *\"I'll meet you in the morning, I'm bound for the promised land.\"* This demonstrated her strategic use of coded communication to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Use of the Underground Railroad**: This escape marked her reliance on the organized network of the Underground Railroad, which she later became a prominent conductor for. She traveled by foot at night, guided by the North Star, and avoided slave catchers over a 90-mile journey.\n\n4. **Maturity and Strategy**: By this point, Tubman had developed the skills and resolve to navigate the dangers of the Underground Railroad, which contrasted with her earlier, more chaotic escape attempts.

Her findings of fossils like plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and pterosaurs challenged the prevailing belief that no species went extinct, providing critical support for the idea that Earth's history included creatures now extinct. These discoveries, alongside those of Gideon Mantell and William Buckland (who found early dinosaur fossils), helped establish the concept of an \"age of reptiles\" and advanced the field of palaeontology. Georges Cuvier had earlier argued for extinction based on mammoth fossils, but Anning's work provided concrete, undeniable evidence that reshaped scientific understanding.",

      "\n\nMary Anning: Anning's discoveries became key pieces of evidence for extinction. \nGeorges Cuvier had argued for the reality of extinction in the late 1790s based on his analysis of fossils of mammals such as mammoths. \nNevertheless, until the early 1820s it was still believed by many scientifically literate people that just as new species did not appear, so existing ones did not become extinct—in part because they felt that extinction would imply that God's creation had been imperfect; any oddities found were explained away as belonging to animals still living somewhere in an unexplored region of the Earth. \nThe bizarre nature of the fossils found by Anning, — some, such as the plesiosaur, so unlike any known living creature — struck a major blow against this idea.The ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and pterosaur she found, along with the first dinosaur fossils which were discovered by Gideon Mantell and William Buckland during the same period, showed that during previous eras the Earth was inhabited by creatures very different from those living today, and provided important support for another controversial suggestion of Cuvier's: that there had been an \"age of reptiles\" when reptiles rather than mammals had been the dominant form of animal life. ",
      "\n\nThis phrase became popular after the publication in 1831 of a paper by Mantell entitled \"The Age of Reptiles\" that summarised the evidence that there had been an extended geological era when giant reptiles has swarmed the land, air, and sea. \nThese discoveries also played a key role in the development of a new discipline of geohistorical analysis within geology in the 1820s that sought to understand the history of the Earth by using evidence from fossils to reconstruct extinct organisms and the environments in which they lived. \nThis discipline eventually came to be called palaeontology. \nIllustrations of scenes from \"deep time\" (now known as palaeoart), such as Henry De la Beche's ground-breaking painting Duria Antiquior, helped convince people that it was possible to understand life in the distant past. \nDe la Beche had been inspired to create the painting by a vivid description of the food chain of the Lias by William Buckland that was based on analysis of coprolites. \nThe study of coprolites, pioneered by Anning and Buckland, would prove to be a valuable tool for understanding ancient ecosystems.",
      "\n\nManeless lions have also been reported in Senegal, in Sudan's Dinder National Park and in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya. \nThe original male white lion from Timbavati was also maneless. \nThe hormone testosterone has been linked to mane growth; castrated lions often have little to no mane because the removal of the gonads inhibits testosterone production. \nIncreased testosterone may be the cause of maned lionesses reported in northern Botswana.Cave paintings of extinct Eurasian cave lions almost exclusively show hunting animals without a mane; some suggest that this is evidence that they were indeed maneless. \nBecause the hunting usually involved groups of lionesses, however, this presumption remains unproven. \nIn the Chauvet Cave is a sketchy drawing of two maneless lions. \nOne lion is mostly obscured by the other. \nThe lion's mane may have evolved around 320,000–190,000 years ago."

Scholars have shown increasing interest in her literary output, particularly in her novels, which include the historical novels Valperga (1823) and Perkin Warbeck (1830), the apocalyptic novel The Last Man (1826), and her final two novels, Lodore (1835) and Falkner (1837). Studies of her lesser-known works, such as the travel book Rambles in Germany and Italy (1844) and the biographical articles for Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia (1829–1846), support the growing view that Mary Shelley remained a political radical throughout her life. Mary Shelley's works often argue that cooperation and sympathy, particularly as practised by women in the family, were the ways to reform civil society. This view was a direct challenge to the individualistic Romantic ethos promoted by Percy Shelley and the Enlightenment political theories articulated by her father, William Godwin.",

      "\n\nPlastic number: Dutch architect & Benedictine monk Dom Hans van der Laan gave the name plastic number (Dutch: het plastische getal) to this number in 1928. In 1924, four years prior to van der Laan's christening of the number's name, French engineer Gérard Cordonnier had already discovered the number and referred to it as the radiant number (French: le nombre radiant). Unlike the names of the golden ratio and silver ratio, the word plastic was not intended by van der Laan to refer to a specific substance, but rather in its adjectival sense, meaning something that can be given a three-dimensional shape. This, according to Richard Padovan, is because the characteristic ratios of the number, 3/4 and 1/7, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church to these plastic number proportions.The plastic number is also sometimes called the silver number, a name given to it by Midhat J. Gazalé and subsequently used by Martin Gardner, but that name is more commonly used for the silver ratio 1 + √2, one of the ratios from the family of metallic means first described by Vera W. de Spinadel in 1998.Donald E.

      "\n\nWorld Wide Web: Scholars generally agree that a turning point for the World Wide Web began with the introduction of the Mosaic web browser in 1993, a graphical browser developed by a team at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (NCSA-UIUC), led by Marc Andreessen. \nFunding for Mosaic came from the US High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative and the High Performance Computing Act of 1991, one of several computing developments initiated by US Senator Al Gore. \nPrior to the release of Mosaic, graphics were not commonly mixed with text in web pages and the web's popularity was less than that of older protocols in use over the Internet, such as Gopher and Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS). \nMosaic's graphical user interface allowed the Web to become, by far, the most popular Internet protocol. \nThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. \nIt was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which had pioneered the Internet; a year later, a second site was founded at INRIA (a French national computer research lab) with support from the European Commission DG InfSo; and in 1996, a third continental site was created in Japan at Keio University. ",
      "\n\nThis date is sometimes confused with the public availability of the first web servers, which had occurred months earlier. \nAs another example of such confusion, several news media reported that the first photo on the Web was published by Berners-Lee in 1992, an image of the CERN house band Les Horribles Cernettes taken by Silvano de Gennaro; Gennaro has disclaimed this story, writing that media were \"totally distorting our words for the sake of cheap sensationalism\".\nThe first server outside Europe was installed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in Palo Alto, California, to host the SPIRES-HEP database. \nAccounts differ substantially as to the date of this event. \nThe World Wide Web Consortium's timeline says December 1992, whereas SLAC itself claims December 1991, as does a W3C document titled A Little History of the World Wide Web. \nThe underlying concept of hypertext originated in previous projects from the 1960s, such as the Hypertext Editing System (HES) at Brown University, Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu, and Douglas Engelbart's oN-Line System (NLS). \nBoth Nelson and Engelbart were in turn inspired by Vannevar Bush's microfilm-based memex, which was described in the 1945 essay \"As We May Think\".\nBerners-Lee's breakthrough was to marry hypertext to the Internet. ",
      "\n\nIn his book Weaving The Web, he explains that he had repeatedly suggested that a marriage between the two technologies was possible to members of both technical communities, but when no one took up his invitation, he finally assumed the project himself. \nIn the process, he developed three essential technologies: the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).\nThe World Wide Web had several differences from other hypertext systems available at the time. \nThe Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. \nIt also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of link rot. \nUnlike predecessors such as HyperCard, the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. \nOn 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due. \nComing two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the Gopher protocol was no longer free to use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and towards the Web. \nAn early popular web browser was ViolaWWW for Unix and the X Window System."

      "\n\nCharles II of England: Charles's English parliament enacted laws known as the Clarendon Code, designed to shore up the position of the re-established Church of England. \nCharles acquiesced to the Clarendon Code even though he favoured a policy of religious tolerance. \nThe major foreign policy issue of his early reign was the Second Anglo-Dutch War. \nIn 1670, he entered into the Treaty of Dover, an alliance with his first cousin King Louis XIV of France. \nLouis agreed to aid him in the Third Anglo-Dutch War and pay him a pension, and Charles secretly promised to convert to Catholicism at an unspecified future date. \nCharles attempted to introduce religious freedom for Catholics and Protestant dissenters with his 1672 Royal Declaration of Indulgence, but the English Parliament forced him to withdraw it. \nIn 1679, Titus Oates's revelations of a supposed Popish Plot sparked the Exclusion Crisis when it was revealed that Charles's brother and heir, James, Duke of York, was a Catholic. \nThe crisis saw the birth of the pro-exclusion Whig and anti-exclusion Tory parties. \nCharles sided with the Tories, and, following the discovery of the Rye House Plot to murder Charles and James in 1683, some Whig leaders were executed or forced into exile. \nCharles dissolved the English Parliament in 1681, and ruled alone until his death on 6 February 1685. \nHe was received into the Catholic Church on his deathbed.

      "\n\nThe inaugural election took place on 29 and 30 March and the first Australian Parliament was opened on 9 May 1901 in Melbourne by Prince George, Duke of Cornwall and York, later King George V. \nThe only building in Melbourne that was large enough to accommodate the 14,000 guests was the western annexe of the Royal Exhibition Building. \nAfter the official opening, from 1901 to 1927 the Parliament met in Parliament House, Melbourne, which it borrowed from the Parliament of Victoria (which sat, instead, in the Royal Exhibition Building until 1927). \nThe principal function of the Parliament is to pass laws, or legislation. \nAny Senator or Member may introduce a proposed law (a bill), except for a money bill (a bill proposing an expenditure or levying a tax), which must be introduced in the House of Representatives. \nIn practice, the great majority of bills are introduced by ministers. \nBills introduced by other Members are called private members' bills. \nAll bills must be passed by both Houses to become law. \nThe Senate has the same legislative powers as the House, except that it may not amend money bills, only pass or reject them. \nThe enacting formula for Acts of Parliament is simply \"The Parliament of Australia enacts:\".\nThe Commonwealth legislative power is limited to that granted in the Constitution. \nPowers not specified are considered \"residual powers\", and remain the domain of the states. \nSection 51 grants the Commonwealth power over areas such as taxation, external affairs, defence and marriage.

      "\n\nIn February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising the Prince of Wales to act as regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons, but before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George III recovered. \nGeorge III hoped that \"the tongue of malice may not paint my intentions in those colours she admires, nor the sycophant extoll me beyond what I deserve\", but in the popular mind George III has been both demonised and praised. \nWhile very popular at the start of his reign, by the mid-1770s George had lost the loyalty of revolutionary American colonists, though it has been estimated that as many as half of the colonists remained loyal. \nThe grievances in the United States Declaration of Independence were presented as \"repeated injuries and usurpations\" that he had committed to establish an \"absolute Tyranny\" over the colonies. \nThe Declaration's wording has contributed to the American public's perception of George as a tyrant. \nContemporary accounts of George III's life fall into two camps: one demonstrating \"attitudes dominant in the latter part of the reign, when the King had become a revered symbol of national resistance to French ideas and French power\", while the other \"derived their views of the King from the bitter partisan strife of the first two decades of the reign, and they expressed in their works the views of the opposition\"."

      "\n\nMay Day: In the Rhineland, 1 May is also celebrated by the delivery of a maypole, a tree covered in streamers to the house of a girl the night before. The tree is typically from a love interest, though a tree wrapped only in white streamers is a sign of dislike. Women usually place roses or rice in the form of a heart at the house of their beloved one. It is common to stick the heart to a window or place it in front of the doormat.

This means the laws of physics are the same for all observers moving at constant velocities relative to each other (inertial frames). The Poincaré group includes:\n   - **Translations** (spacetime shifts),\n   - **Rotations** (spatial orientation changes),\n   - **Boosts** (changes in velocity between frames).\n\n2. **Boosts and Relative Motion**:  \n   A **boost** is a transformation that relates the coordinates of events as observed in two inertial frames moving at constant velocity relative to each other. This symmetry ensures that no frame is privileged—motion is relative, and the speed of light remains constant in all frames.\n\n3. **Consequences for Motion**:  \n   - **Length Contraction**: Objects in motion relative to an observer appear contracted along the direction of motion (e.g., \"pancake\" shapes for fast-moving ions).  \n   - **Time Dilation**: Clocks in motion relative to an observer tick slower.  \n   - **Causality**: The **light cone structure** (defined by the speed of light) ensures no influence can propagate faster than light, preserving a consistent causal order of events across all frames.\n\n4. **Experimental Basis**:  \n   The **Michelson–Morley experiment** (and later Kennedy–Thorndike) demonstrated that no \"aether wind\" was detected, confirming that the speed of light is isotropic and constant in all inertial frames. This supported the Lorentz-invariant framework of special relativity, where length contraction and relativistic effects naturally arise from the symmetry of spacetime.\n\nIn essence, the symmetry of special relativity ensures that **motion is relative**, and the geometry of spacetime (via light cones and Lorentz transformations) dictates how measurements of length, time, and causality behave under changes in velocity.",

It was the negative result of a famous experiment, that required the introduction of length contraction: the Michelson–Morley experiment (and later also the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment). In special relativity its explanation is as follows: In its rest frame the interferometer can be regarded as at rest in accordance with the relativity principle, so the propagation time of light is the same in all directions. Although in a frame in which the interferometer is in motion, the transverse beam must traverse a longer, diagonal path with respect to the non-moving frame thus making its travel time longer, the factor by which the longitudinal beam would be delayed by taking times L/(c-v) & L/(c+v) for the forward and reverse trips respectively is even longer. Therefore, in the longitudinal direction the interferometer is supposed to be contracted, in order to restore the equality of both travel times in accordance with the negative experimental result(s). Thus the two-way speed of light remains constant and the round trip propagation time along perpendicular arms of the interferometer is independent of its motion & orientation.",

      "\n\nAt the base of classical mechanics is the notion that a body's motion can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion. \nSuch deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. \nThe preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. \nIn modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.Conversely, one might expect that inertial motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), can be used to define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate. \nHowever, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. \nAccording to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors (see Eötvös experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties.

It was the negative result of a famous experiment, that required the introduction of length contraction: the Michelson–Morley experiment (and later also the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment). In special relativity its explanation is as follows: In its rest frame the interferometer can be regarded as at rest in accordance with the relativity principle, so the propagation time of light is the same in all directions. Although in a frame in which the interferometer is in motion, the transverse beam must traverse a longer, diagonal path with respect to the non-moving frame thus making its travel time longer, the factor by which the longitudinal beam would be delayed by taking times L/(c-v) & L/(c+v) for the forward and reverse trips respectively is even longer. Therefore, in the longitudinal direction the interferometer is supposed to be contracted, in order to restore the equality of both travel times in accordance with the negative experimental result(s). Thus the two-way speed of light remains constant and the round trip propagation time along perpendicular arms of the interferometer is independent of its motion & orientation.",

In 1986 Showalter et al. inferred its orbit and mass by modeling its gravitational wake. They arrived at a very precise prediction of 133,603 ± 10 km for the semi-major axis and a mass of 5–10×10−12 Saturn masses, and inferred that there was only a single moon within the Encke gap. The actual semi-major axis differs by 19 km and the actual mass is 8.6×10−12 of Saturn's. The moon was later found within 1° of the predicted position. The search was undertaken by considering all Voyager 2 images and using a computer calculation to predict whether the moon would be visible under sufficiently favorable conditions in each one.

      "\n\nOne country, two systems: \"One country, two systems\" is a constitutional principle formulated by Deng Xiaoping, the Paramount Leader of the People's Republic of China (PRC), for the reunification of China during the early 1980s. He suggested that there would be only one China, but distinct Chinese regions such as Hong Kong and Macau could retain their own economic and administrative systems, while the rest of the PRC (or simply \"China\") uses the socialism with Chinese characteristics system. Under the principle, each of the two regions could continue to have its own governmental system, legal, economic and financial affairs, including trade relations with foreign countries. Deng Xiaoping proposed to apply the principle to Hong Kong in the negotiation with the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher over the future of Hong Kong when the lease of the New Territories (including New Kowloon) of Hong Kong to the United Kingdom was to expire in 1997. The same principle was proposed in talks with Portugal about Macau.",
