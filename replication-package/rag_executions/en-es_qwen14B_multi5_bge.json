The sandfly becomes infected when biting an infected human in the period between 48 hours before the onset of fever and 24 hours after the end of the fever, and remains infected for its lifetime. Besides this horizontal virus transmission from man to sandfly, the virus can be transmitted in insects transovarially, from an infected female sandfly to its offspring.Pappataci fever is seldom recognised in endemic populations because it is mixed with other febrile illnesses of childhood, but it is more well-known among immigrants and military personnel from non-endemic regions."

This, according to Richard Padovan, is because the characteristic ratios of the number, 3/4 and 1/7, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church to these plastic number proportions.The plastic number is also sometimes called the silver number, a name given to it by Midhat J.

    "response": "El proceso mediante el cual un elemento se transforma en otro se llama **transmutaci√≥n nuclear** y ocurre a trav√©s de **reacciones nucleares**, no qu√≠micas. Esto implica cambios en el n√∫cleo de los √°tomos, alterando el n√∫mero de protones (lo que define el elemento). Los m√©todos principales son:\n\n### 1. **Fisi√≥n nuclear**  \n   - Un n√∫cleo pesado (como el uranio-235) se divide en n√∫cleos m√°s ligeros, liberando energ√≠a. Por ejemplo, el uranio se puede transformar en elementos como **kript√≥n** y **bario** durante la fisi√≥n.\n\n### 2. **Fusi√≥n nuclear**  \n   - N√∫cleos ligeros (como el hidr√≥geno) se unen para formar n√∫cleos m√°s pesados (como el helio). Este proceso ocurre en las estrellas y es c√≥mo se forman elementos como el carbono, ox√≠geno y hierro.\n\n### 3. **Decaimiento radiactivo**  \n   - Un n√∫cleo inestable pierde part√≠culas (alfa, beta) o energ√≠a (gamma), cambiando su n√∫mero de protones. Por ejemplo:  \n     - **Decaimiento alfa**: El uranio-238 se convierte en torio-234 al emitir una part√≠cula alfa (2 protones + 2 neutrones).  \n     - **Decaimiento beta**: Un neutr√≥n se convierte en un prot√≥n (o viceversa), transformando el elemento (ej.: carbono-14 ‚Üí nitr√≥geno-14).\n\n### 4. **Transmutaci√≥n artificial**  \n   - En laboratorios, se bombardea un elemento con part√≠culas (como neutrones o protones) para alterar su n√∫cleo.

      "\n\nHistory of chemistry: Around 420 BC, Empedocles stated that all matter is made up of four elemental substances: earth, fire, air and water. \nThe early theory of atomism can be traced back to ancient Greece and ancient India. \nGreek atomism dates back to the Greek philosopher Democritus, who declared that matter is composed of indivisible and indestructible particles called \"atomos\" around 380 BC. \nLeucippus also declared that atoms were the most indivisible part of matter. \nThis coincided with a similar declaration by Indian philosopher Kanada in his Vaisheshika sutras around the same time period. \nIn much the same fashion he discussed the existence of gases. \nWhat Kanada declared by sutra, Democritus declared by philosophical musing. \nBoth suffered from a lack of empirical data. \nWithout scientific proof, the existence of atoms was easy to deny. \nAristotle opposed the existence of atoms in 330 BC. \nEarlier, in 380 BC, a Greek text attributed to Polybus argued that the human body is composed of four humours. \nAround 300 BC, Epicurus postulated a universe of indestructible atoms in which man himself is responsible for achieving a balanced life. \nThe history of chemistry represents a time span from ancient history to the present. \nBy 1000 BC, civilizations used technologies that would eventually form the basis of the various branches of chemistry.

Unlike the names of the golden ratio and silver ratio, the word plastic was not intended by van der Laan to refer to a specific substance, but rather in its adjectival sense, meaning something that can be given a three-dimensional shape. This, according to Richard Padovan, is because the characteristic ratios of the number, 3/4 and 1/7, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church to these plastic number proportions.The plastic number is also sometimes called the silver number, a name given to it by Midhat J. Gazal√© and subsequently used by Martin Gardner, but that name is more commonly used for the silver ratio 1 + ‚àö2, one of the ratios from the family of metallic means first described by Vera W. de Spinadel in 1998.Donald E.

      "\n\nAccording to Plato, the four elements are derived from a common source or prima materia (first matter), associated with chaos. \nPrima materia is also the name alchemists assign to the starting ingredient for the creation of the philosopher's stone. \nThe importance of this philosophical first matter persisted throughout the history of alchemy. \nIn the seventeenth century, Thomas Vaughan writes, \"the first matter of the stone is the very same with the first matter of all things\". \nThe philosopher's stone, more properly philosophers' stone or stone of the philosophers (Latin: lapis philosophorum) is a legendary alchemical substance capable of turning base metals such as mercury into gold (chrysopoeia, from the Greek œáœÅœÖœÉœåœÇ khrusos, \"gold\", and œÄŒøŒπŒµ·øñŒΩ poiƒìin, \"to make\") or silver. \nIt is also called the elixir of life, useful for rejuvenation and for achieving immortality; for many centuries, it was the most sought goal in alchemy. \nThe philosopher's stone was the central symbol of the mystical terminology of alchemy, symbolizing perfection at its finest, enlightenment, and heavenly bliss. \nEfforts to discover the philosopher's stone were known as the Magnum Opus (\"Great Work\").",
      "\n\nTruth serum: the European Court of Human Rights arguing that use of a truth serum could be considered a violation of a human right to be free from degrading treatment, or could be considered a form of torture. It has been noted to be a violation of the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture.\"Truth serum\" was abused against psychotic patients as part of old, discredited practices of psychiatry and is no longer used. In a therapeutic context, the controlled administration of intravenous hypnotic medications is called \"narcosynthesis\" or \"narcoanalysis\". Such application was first documented by Dr. William Bleckwenn. Reliability and suggestibility of patients are concerns, and the practice of chemically inducing an involuntary mental state is now widely considered to be a form of torture."

      "\n\nPlastic number: Dutch architect & Benedictine monk Dom Hans van der Laan gave the name plastic number (Dutch: het plastische getal) to this number in 1928. In 1924, four years prior to van der Laan's christening of the number's name, French engineer G√©rard Cordonnier had already discovered the number and referred to it as the radiant number (French: le nombre radiant). Unlike the names of the golden ratio and silver ratio, the word plastic was not intended by van der Laan to refer to a specific substance, but rather in its adjectival sense, meaning something that can be given a three-dimensional shape. This, according to Richard Padovan, is because the characteristic ratios of the number, 3/4 and 1/7, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church to these plastic number proportions.The plastic number is also sometimes called the silver number, a name given to it by Midhat J. Gazal√© and subsequently used by Martin Gardner, but that name is more commonly used for the silver ratio 1 + ‚àö2, one of the ratios from the family of metallic means first described by Vera W. de Spinadel in 1998.Donald E.

A prominence is a large, bright, gaseous feature extending outward from the Sun's surface, often in a loop shape. Prominences are anchored to the Sun's surface in the photosphere, and extend outwards into the Sun's corona.  While the corona consists of extremely hot ionized gases, known as plasma, which do not emit much visible light, prominences contain much cooler plasma, similar in composition to that of the chromosphere.

      "\n\nLion: Early phylogenetic research was focused on East and Southern African lions, and already showed they can possibly be divided in two main clades; one to the west and the other to the east of the East African Rift. \nLions in eastern Kenya are genetically much closer to lions in Southern Africa than to lions in Aberdare National Park in western Kenya. \nIn a subsequent study, tissue and bone samples of 32 lion specimens in museums were used. \nResults indicated lions form three phylogeographic groups: one each in Asia and North Africa, in Central Africa and in Southern Africa. \nUp to 480 lion samples from up to 22 countries were analysed in subsequent phylogenetic studies, with results indicating two main evolutionary lion groups.Samples of 53 lions, both wild and captive, from 15 countries were used for phylogenetic analysis. \nResults showed little genetic diversity among lion samples from Asia and West and Central Africa, whereas samples from East and Southern Africa revealed numerous mutations supporting this group having a longer evolutionary history. \nResults of subsequent phylogeographic research indicate that the lion diverged into northern (North and West African and Asian) and southern (East and Southern African) lineages about 245,000 years ago. ",
      "\n\nExtinction of lions in southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East interrupted gene flow between lions in Asia and Africa.More than 190 lion samples were available for phylogeographic research, including eight wild lion samples from the Ethiopian Highlands. \nThree of them originated in the Ogaden Region, Gambela and Bale Mountains National Parks and clustered with lion samples from Chad and Cameroon. \nFive lion samples from other areas in Ethiopia clustered with lion samples from East Africa. \nScientists therefore assume that Ethiopia is a contact zone between the two subspecies. \nLions do not usually hunt humans but some ‚Äì usually males ‚Äì seem to seek them out. \nOne well-publicised case is the Tsavo maneaters; in 1898, 28 officially recorded railway workers building the Kenya-Uganda Railway were taken by lions over nine months during the construction of a bridge over the Tsavo River in Kenya. \nThe hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals' predatory behaviour; they were larger than normal and lacked manes, and one seemed to suffer from tooth decay.

      "\n\nCases in Lindi in which lions seize humans from the centres of substantial villages have been documented. \nAnother study of 1,000 people attacked by lions in southern Tanzania between 1988 and 2009 found that the weeks following the full moon, when there was less moonlight, were a strong indicator of increased night-time attacks on people.According to Robert R. \nFrump, Mozambican refugees regularly crossing Kruger National Park, South Africa, at night are attacked and eaten by lions; park officials have said man-eating is a problem there. \nFrump said thousands may have been killed in the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced refugees to cross the park at night. \nFor nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly crossed the park in daytime with little harm.Packer estimates between 200 and 400 Tanzanians are killed each year by wild animals and that lions are thought to kill at least 70 of these. \nAccording to Packer between 1990 and 2004, lions attacked 815 people in Tanzania and killed 563. \nPacker and Ikanda are among the few conservationists who believe western conservation efforts must take account of these matters because of ethical concerns about human life and the long-term success of conservation efforts and lion preservation.A man-eating lion was killed by game scouts in Southern Tanzania in April 2004. \nIt is believed to have killed and eaten at least 35 people in a series of incidents covering several villages in the coastal Rufiji Delta region. \nDr Rolf D. ",
      "\n\nBaldus, the GTZ wildlife programme coordinator, said it was likely that the lion preyed on humans because it had a large abscess beneath a cracked molar and wrote, \"This lion probably experienced a lot of pain, particularly when it was chewing\".\nThe \"All-Africa\" record of man-eating generally is considered to be a collection of incidents between the early 1930s and the late 1940s in modern-day Tanzania inflicted by a pride known as the \"Njombe lions\". \nGame warden and hunter George Rushby eventually dispatched the pride, which over three generations is thought to have killed and eaten 1,500 to 2,000 people in Njombe district.The area of the Gir National Park is now insufficient to sustain large lion numbers. \nLions dispersed outside the protected area and are a potential threat to people in and around the park. \nTwo attacks on humans were reported in 2012 in an area about 50‚Äì60 km (31‚Äì37 mi) from the sanctuary. \nThe lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae; it is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. \nThe lion is sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females with a typical weight range of 150 to 250 kg (330 to 550 lb) for males and 120 to 182 kg (265 to 400 lb) for females. ",
      "\n\nThe infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favoured by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans.In their analysis of man-eating ‚Äì including the Tsavo incident ‚Äì Kerbis Peterhans and Gnoske acknowledge that sick or injured animals may be more prone to man-eating but that the behaviour is \"not unusual, nor necessarily 'aberrant'\" where the opportunity exists; if inducements such as access to livestock or human corpses are present, lions will regularly prey upon human beings. \nThe authors note the relationship is well-attested among other pantherines and primates in the fossil record.The lion's proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. \nAmerican and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behaviour in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. \nAt least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period ‚Äì a number far exceeding the Tsavo attacks. \nThe incidents occurred near Selous National Park in Rufiji District and in Lindi Province near the Mozambican border. \nWhile the expansion of villages into bush country is one concern, the authors argue conservation policy must mitigate the danger because in this case, conservation contributes directly to human deaths.

She coauthored the book Crisis in the Population Question (Swedish: Kris i befolkningsfr√•gan with Gunnar Myrdal in 1934).

The book also detailed the importance of shared responsibility for children's education both between the parents as well as the community by trained child educators."

      "\n\nFrench colonial empire: In the middle of the 18th century, a series of colonial conflicts began between France and Britain, which ultimately resulted in the destruction of most of the first French colonial empire and the near-complete expulsion of France from the Americas. These wars were the War of the Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì1748), the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763), the American Revolution (1765‚Äì1783), the French Revolutionary Wars (1793‚Äì1802) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803‚Äì1815). It may even be seen further back in time to the first of the French and Indian Wars. This cyclic conflict is sometimes known as the Second Hundred Years' War. The French colonial empire began to fall during the Second World War, when various parts were occupied by foreign powers (Japan in Indochina, Britain in Syria, Lebanon, and Madagascar, the United States and Britain in Morocco and Algeria, and Germany and Italy in Tunisia). However, control was gradually reestablished by Charles de Gaulle. The French Union, included in the Constitution of 1946, nominally replaced the former colonial empire, but officials in Paris remained in full control. The colonies were given local assemblies with only limited local power and budgets. There emerged a group of elites, known as evolu√©s, who were natives of the overseas territories but lived in metropolitan France.",

Unlike the names of the golden ratio and silver ratio, the word plastic was not intended by van der Laan to refer to a specific substance, but rather in its adjectival sense, meaning something that can be given a three-dimensional shape. This, according to Richard Padovan, is because the characteristic ratios of the number, 3/4 and 1/7, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church to these plastic number proportions.The plastic number is also sometimes called the silver number, a name given to it by Midhat J.

      "\n\nWorld Wide Web: The proposal was modelled after the SGML reader Dynatext by Electronic Book Technology, a spin-off from the Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship at Brown University. \nThe Dynatext system, licensed by CERN, was a key player in the extension of SGML ISO 8879:1986 to Hypermedia within HyTime, but it was considered too expensive and had an inappropriate licensing policy for use in the general high energy physics community, namely a fee for each document and each document alteration. \nA NeXT Computer was used by Berners-Lee as the world's first web server and also to write the first web browser, WorldWideWeb, in 1990. \nBy Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web: the first web browser (which was a web editor as well) and the first web server. \nThe first web site, which described the project itself, was published on 20 December 1990.\nThe first web page may be lost, but Paul Jones of UNC-Chapel Hill in North Carolina announced in May 2013 that Berners-Lee gave him what he says is the oldest known web page during a 1991 visit to UNC. \nJones stored it on a magneto-optical drive and on his NeXT computer. \nOn 6 August 1991, Berners-Lee published a short summary of the World Wide Web project on the newsgroup alt.hypertext. \nThis date is sometimes confused with the public availability of the first web servers, which had occurred months earlier.

      "\n\nLess well-received was the voice acting which, although some reviewers remarked it was better than that found in the Resident Evil series, was found poor overall by reviewers, and accompanied by pauses between lines that served to spoil the atmosphere.Reviewers noted that Silent Hill used real-time 3D environments, in contrast to the pre-rendered environments found in Resident Evil. \nFog and darkness were heavily used to disguise the limitations of the hardware. \nAlong with the grainy textures‚Äîalso from hardware limitations‚Äîmost reviewers felt that these factors actually worked in the game's favor; Francesca Reyes of IGN described it as \"adding to the atmosphere of dilapidation and decay\". \nIn using 3D environments, however, controls became an issue, and in \"tougher\" areas, maneuverability became \"an exercise in frustration\".\nThe game's popularity as the first in the series was further recognized long after its release; a list of the best PS games of all time by IGN in 2000 listed it as the 14th-best PS game, while a 2005 article by GameSpy detailing the best PS games listed Silent Hill as the 15th-best game produced for the console. \nA GameTrailers video feature in 2006 ranked Silent Hill as number one in its list of the top ten scariest games of all time.

      "\n\nAlways eager to harm the crown prince, the imperial chancellor continued his intrigues against Victoria. \nWith the help of chamberlain Hugo von Radolinski and painter G√∂tz de Seckendorff, he tried to prepare a final report against the crown princess. \nIn October 1889, Princess Sophia, Victoria's penultimate daughter, married the future King Constantine I of Greece, leaving the maternal residence. \nThe following year, Princess Viktoria, after the ending of her hopes to wed the ruler of Bulgaria, in the end married Prince Adolf of Schaumburg-Lippe, the future regent of the Principality of Lippe. \nFinally, in 1893, Princess Margaret married Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse, who in 1918 was elected to the throne of the ephemeral Kingdom of Finland. \nAlthough satisfied with these marriages, the empress dowager felt increasingly isolated following the departure of her daughters. \nThe Berlin court of the royal couple was chosen by Queen Elizabeth and Princess Augusta, Frederick's aunt and mother. \nThey summoned people who had been in court service for a long time and were much older than Victoria and Frederick. \nPrince Albert therefore asked the Hohenzollerns that his daughter could keep at least two ladies-in-waiting who were her age and of British origin. \nHis request was not completely denied but, as a compromise, Victoria received two young ladies-in-waiting of German origin: Countesses Walburga von Hohenthal and Marie zu Lynar.

The initially wooden barracks was designed by Krikor Balyan. It was burnt down in 1806 by revolting Janissaries, who were against the reforms. Ordered by Sultan Mahmud II, rebuilding of the barracks in stone began in 1825 and it was completed on 6 February 1828. It is a gigantic rectangle building 200 m √ó 267 m (656 ft √ó 876 ft) with a large parade ground in the centre. The structure has three floors on three wings and two floors only on the eastern wing due to inclined terrain. During the reign of Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I, the barracks were renovated twice, first in 1842‚Äì43 and again in 1849‚Äì50. During this process, a tower seven stories in height was added to each of the four corners, giving the barracks the look they have today."

It replaced the iBook series and 12-inch PowerBook series of notebooks as a part of Apple's transition from PowerPC to Intel processors. Positioned as the low end of the MacBook family, below the premium ultra-portable MacBook Air and the powerful MacBook Pro,  the MacBook was aimed at the consumer and education markets.  It was the best-selling Macintosh ever. For five months in 2008, it was the best-selling laptop of any brand in US retail stores.  Collectively, the MacBook brand is the \"world's top-selling line of premium laptops.\"There have been four separate designs of the MacBook. The original model used a combination of polycarbonate and fiberglass casing which was modeled after the iBook G4. The second type was introduced in October 2008 alongside the 15-inch MacBook Pro; the MacBook shared the more expensive laptop's unibody aluminium casing, but omitted FireWire.  A third design, introduced in late 2009, had a polycarbonate unibody casing."

      "\n\nGeneral relativity: Soon after publishing the special theory of relativity in 1905, Einstein started thinking about how to incorporate gravity into his new relativistic framework. \nIn 1907, beginning with a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall, he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity. \nAfter numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations. \nThese equations specify how the geometry of space and time is influenced by whatever matter and radiation are present, and form the core of Einstein's general theory of relativity.The Einstein field equations are nonlinear and very difficult to solve. \nEinstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory. \nBut as early as 1916, the astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild found the first non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the Schwarzschild metric. \nThis solution laid the groundwork for the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes. \nIn the same year, the first steps towards generalizing Schwarzschild's solution to electrically charged objects were taken, which eventually resulted in the Reissner‚ÄìNordstr√∂m solution, now associated with electrically charged black holes. \nIn 1917, Einstein applied his theory to the universe as a whole, initiating the field of relativistic cosmology.

In terms of tissue type, the body may be analyzed into water, fat, connective tissue, muscle, bone, etc. In terms of cell type, the body contains hundreds of different types of cells, but notably, the largest number of cells contained in a human body (though not the largest mass of cells) are not human cells, but bacteria residing in the normal human gastrointestinal tract. There are many species of bacteria and other microorganisms that live on or inside the healthy human body. In fact, 90% of the cells in (or on) a human body are microbes, by number (much less by mass or volume). Some of these symbionts are necessary for our health. Those that neither help nor harm humans are called commensal organisms."

      "\n\nFifth force: A new fundamental force might be difficult to test. Gravity, for example, is such a weak force that the gravitational interaction between two objects is only significant when one of them has a great mass. Therefore, it takes very sensitive equipment to measure gravitational interactions between objects that are small compared to the Earth. A new (or \"fifth\") fundamental force might similarly be weak and therefore difficult to detect. Nonetheless, in the late 1980s a fifth force, operating on municipal scales (i.e. with a range of about 100 meters), was reported by researchers (Fischbach et al.) who were reanalyzing results of Lor√°nd E√∂tv√∂s from earlier in the century. The force was believed to be linked with hypercharge. Over a number of years, other experiments have failed to duplicate this result.There are at least three kinds of searches that can be undertaken, which depend on the kind of force being considered, and its range. Some speculative theories have proposed a fifth force to explain various anomalous observations that do not fit existing theories.  The characteristics of this fifth force depend on the theory being advanced.

      "\n\nFifth force: A new fundamental force might be difficult to test. Gravity, for example, is such a weak force that the gravitational interaction between two objects is only significant when one of them has a great mass. Therefore, it takes very sensitive equipment to measure gravitational interactions between objects that are small compared to the Earth. A new (or \"fifth\") fundamental force might similarly be weak and therefore difficult to detect. Nonetheless, in the late 1980s a fifth force, operating on municipal scales (i.e. with a range of about 100 meters), was reported by researchers (Fischbach et al.) who were reanalyzing results of Lor√°nd E√∂tv√∂s from earlier in the century. The force was believed to be linked with hypercharge. Over a number of years, other experiments have failed to duplicate this result.There are at least three kinds of searches that can be undertaken, which depend on the kind of force being considered, and its range. Some speculative theories have proposed a fifth force to explain various anomalous observations that do not fit existing theories.  The characteristics of this fifth force depend on the theory being advanced. Many postulate a force roughly the strength of gravity (i.e. it is much weaker than electromagnetism or the nuclear forces) with a range of anywhere from less than a millimeter to cosmological scales.

      "\n\nHistory of Ireland: Linguists realised from the 17th century onwards that the language spoken by these people, the Goidelic languages, was a branch of the Celtic languages. This is usually explained as a result of invasions by Celts from the continent. However, other research has postulated that the culture developed gradually and continuously, and that the introduction of Celtic language and elements of Celtic culture may have been a result of cultural exchange with Celtic groups in southwest continental Europe from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.The hypothesis that the native Late Bronze Age inhabitants gradually absorbed Celtic influences has since been supported by some recent genetic research.The Romans referred to Ireland as Scotia 500 CE, and later Hibernia. Ptolemy, in 100 CE, recorded Ireland's geography and tribes. Ireland was never a part of the Roman Empire, but Roman influence was often projected well beyond its borders. Tacitus writes that an exiled Irish prince was with Agricola in Roman Britain and would return to seize power in Ireland. Juvenal tells us that Roman \"arms had been taken beyond the shores of Ireland\". In recent years, some experts have hypothesized that Roman-sponsored Gaelic forces (or perhaps even Roman regulars) mounted some kind of invasion around 100 CE, but the exact relationship between Rome and the dynasties and peoples of Hibernia remains unclear.",

Scholars have shown increasing interest in her literary output, particularly in her novels, which include the historical novels Valperga (1823) and Perkin Warbeck (1830), the apocalyptic novel The Last Man (1826), and her final two novels, Lodore (1835) and Falkner (1837). Studies of her lesser-known works, such as the travel book Rambles in Germany and Italy (1844) and the biographical articles for Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia (1829‚Äì1846), support the growing view that Mary Shelley remained a political radical throughout her life. Mary Shelley's works often argue that cooperation and sympathy, particularly as practised by women in the family, were the ways to reform civil society. This view was a direct challenge to the individualistic Romantic ethos promoted by Percy Shelley and the Enlightenment political theories articulated by her father, William Godwin.",

This, according to Richard Padovan, is because the characteristic ratios of the number, 3/4 and 1/7, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church to these plastic number proportions.The plastic number is also sometimes called the silver number, a name given to it by Midhat J.

      "\n\nAlways eager to harm the crown prince, the imperial chancellor continued his intrigues against Victoria. \nWith the help of chamberlain Hugo von Radolinski and painter G√∂tz de Seckendorff, he tried to prepare a final report against the crown princess. \nIn October 1889, Princess Sophia, Victoria's penultimate daughter, married the future King Constantine I of Greece, leaving the maternal residence. \nThe following year, Princess Viktoria, after the ending of her hopes to wed the ruler of Bulgaria, in the end married Prince Adolf of Schaumburg-Lippe, the future regent of the Principality of Lippe. \nFinally, in 1893, Princess Margaret married Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse, who in 1918 was elected to the throne of the ephemeral Kingdom of Finland. \nAlthough satisfied with these marriages, the empress dowager felt increasingly isolated following the departure of her daughters. \nThe Berlin court of the royal couple was chosen by Queen Elizabeth and Princess Augusta, Frederick's aunt and mother. \nThey summoned people who had been in court service for a long time and were much older than Victoria and Frederick. \nPrince Albert therefore asked the Hohenzollerns that his daughter could keep at least two ladies-in-waiting who were her age and of British origin. \nHis request was not completely denied but, as a compromise, Victoria received two young ladies-in-waiting of German origin: Countesses Walburga von Hohenthal and Marie zu Lynar.

      "\n\nThe cancer spread to her spine by the autumn of 1900, and as she worried about her personal letters (in which she detailed her concern over Germany's future under her son) falling into the hands of the emperor, she requested that the letters be brought back to Great Britain in a cloak-and-dagger operation by her godson Frederick Ponsonby, the private secretary of her brother King Edward VII, who was making his final visit to his terminally ill sister in Kronberg on 23 February 1901. \nThese letters were later edited by Ponsonby and put into context by his background commentary to form the book that was published in 1928. \nWith the death of King Frederick William IV on 2 January 1861, his brother, who had acted as regent since 1858, ascended the throne as King William I. \nFrederick was then the new crown prince of Prussia but his situation at court did not change much: his father refused to increase his allowance, and Crown Princess Victoria continued to contribute significantly to the family budget with her dowry and allowance. \nIn a letter to the Baron von Stockmar, Prince Albert commented on the situation:"

      "\n\nMilk clashes with the local gay \"establishment\" which he feels to be too cautious and risk-averse. \nIn early 1991, Oliver Stone was planning to produce, but not direct, a film on Milk's life; he wrote a script for the film, called The Mayor of Castro Street. \nIn July 1992, director Gus Van Sant was signed with Warner Bros. to direct the biopic with actor Robin Williams in the lead role. \nBy April 1993, Van Sant parted ways with the studio, citing creative differences. \nOther actors considered for Harvey Milk at the time included Richard Gere, Daniel Day-Lewis, Al Pacino, and James Woods. \nMilk and White forge a complex working relationship. \nMilk is invited to, and attends, the christening of White's first child, and White asks for Milk's assistance in preventing a psychiatric hospital from opening in White's district, possibly in exchange for White's support of Milk's citywide gay rights ordinance. \nWhen Milk fails to support White because of the negative effect it will have on troubled youth, White feels betrayed, and ultimately becomes the sole vote against the gay rights ordinance. \nMilk also launches an effort to defeat Proposition 6, an initiative on the California state ballot in November 1978. \nSponsored by John Briggs, a conservative state legislator from Orange County, Proposition 6 seeks to ban gays and lesbians (in addition to anyone who supports them) from working in California's public schools.

      "\n\nAlways eager to harm the crown prince, the imperial chancellor continued his intrigues against Victoria. \nWith the help of chamberlain Hugo von Radolinski and painter G√∂tz de Seckendorff, he tried to prepare a final report against the crown princess. \nIn October 1889, Princess Sophia, Victoria's penultimate daughter, married the future King Constantine I of Greece, leaving the maternal residence. \nThe following year, Princess Viktoria, after the ending of her hopes to wed the ruler of Bulgaria, in the end married Prince Adolf of Schaumburg-Lippe, the future regent of the Principality of Lippe. \nFinally, in 1893, Princess Margaret married Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse, who in 1918 was elected to the throne of the ephemeral Kingdom of Finland. \nAlthough satisfied with these marriages, the empress dowager felt increasingly isolated following the departure of her daughters. \nThe Berlin court of the royal couple was chosen by Queen Elizabeth and Princess Augusta, Frederick's aunt and mother. \nThey summoned people who had been in court service for a long time and were much older than Victoria and Frederick. \nPrince Albert therefore asked the Hohenzollerns that his daughter could keep at least two ladies-in-waiting who were her age and of British origin. \nHis request was not completely denied but, as a compromise, Victoria received two young ladies-in-waiting of German origin: Countesses Walburga von Hohenthal and Marie zu Lynar.

      "\n\nThe Avengers (2012 film): In Stuttgart, Barton steals iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. \nWhile Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., Thor, his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. \nAfter a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier. \nUpon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract. \nMark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk: A genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated. \nRuffalo, who was considered to play Banner in The Incredible Hulk before Edward Norton took the role, was cast after negotiations between Marvel and Norton broke down. \nAbout replacing Norton, Ruffalo said, \"I'm a friend of Ed's, and yeah, that wasn't a great way for all that to go down. \nBut the way I see it is that Ed has bequeathed this part to me. \nI look at it as my generation's Hamlet.\" ",
      "\n\nAbout the character, he said, \"He's a guy struggling with two sides of himself‚Äîthe dark and the light‚Äîand everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control. \nI grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series, which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk. \nI like that the part has those qualities\". \nRegarding the Hulk's place on the team, Ruffalo said, \"He's like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team. \nHe's a loose cannon. \nIt's like, 'Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let's hope it turns out well!\" \nThis is the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk. \nRuffalo told New York magazine, \"I'm really excited. \nNo one's ever played the Hulk exactly; they've always done CGI. \nThey're going to do the Avatar stop-action, stop-motion capture. \nSo I'll actually play the Hulk. \nThat'll be fun\". \nThe 3D model used to create the Hulk's body was modeled after Long Island bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm, while the Hulk's face was modeled after Ruffalo. \nTo create the Hulk's voice, Ruffalo's voice was blended with those of Lou Ferrigno and others; however, the Hulk's only speaking line (\"Puny god.\") was provided solely by Ruffalo.

      "\n\nRuffalo earned $2-3 million for the film. \nRogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's location. \nBanner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians. \nThe Hulk finds Loki and beats him into submission. \nRomanoff makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. \nMeanwhile, Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at Midtown Manhattan. \nStark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. \nThe missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. \nStark's suit loses power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. \nStark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground. \nIn the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed. \nThe film's development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April 2005. \nAfter the success of the film Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers would be released in July 2011.

      "\n\nLess well-received was the voice acting which, although some reviewers remarked it was better than that found in the Resident Evil series, was found poor overall by reviewers, and accompanied by pauses between lines that served to spoil the atmosphere.Reviewers noted that Silent Hill used real-time 3D environments, in contrast to the pre-rendered environments found in Resident Evil. \nFog and darkness were heavily used to disguise the limitations of the hardware. \nAlong with the grainy textures‚Äîalso from hardware limitations‚Äîmost reviewers felt that these factors actually worked in the game's favor; Francesca Reyes of IGN described it as \"adding to the atmosphere of dilapidation and decay\". \nIn using 3D environments, however, controls became an issue, and in \"tougher\" areas, maneuverability became \"an exercise in frustration\".\nThe game's popularity as the first in the series was further recognized long after its release; a list of the best PS games of all time by IGN in 2000 listed it as the 14th-best PS game, while a 2005 article by GameSpy detailing the best PS games listed Silent Hill as the 15th-best game produced for the console. \nA GameTrailers video feature in 2006 ranked Silent Hill as number one in its list of the top ten scariest games of all time.

      "\n\nPlastic number: Dutch architect & Benedictine monk Dom Hans van der Laan gave the name plastic number (Dutch: het plastische getal) to this number in 1928. In 1924, four years prior to van der Laan's christening of the number's name, French engineer G√©rard Cordonnier had already discovered the number and referred to it as the radiant number (French: le nombre radiant). Unlike the names of the golden ratio and silver ratio, the word plastic was not intended by van der Laan to refer to a specific substance, but rather in its adjectival sense, meaning something that can be given a three-dimensional shape. This, according to Richard Padovan, is because the characteristic ratios of the number, 3/4 and 1/7, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church to these plastic number proportions.The plastic number is also sometimes called the silver number, a name given to it by Midhat J. Gazal√© and subsequently used by Martin Gardner, but that name is more commonly used for the silver ratio 1 + ‚àö2, one of the ratios from the family of metallic means first described by Vera W. de Spinadel in 1998.Donald E.

Never having met anyone else, he trains himself in an old Guardian pilot simulator every day, eventually mastering it. After his grandfather's death, he emerges to the surface and is selected as a Guardian pilot, just as Sidonia is once again threatened by the Gauna.

      "\n\nThe arrival of Afghan refugees in the western provinces has stimulated interest in Pashto music, although there has been intolerance of it in some places. \nThe territory that now constitutes Pakistan was the site of several ancient cultures and intertwined with the history of the broader Indian subcontinent. \nThe ancient history involves the Neolithic site of Mehrgarh and the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation, and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures, including Hindus, Indo-Greeks, Muslims, Turco-Mongols, Afghans and Sikhs. \nThe area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties, including the Persian Achaemenid Empire, Alexander III of Macedon, the Seleucid Empire, the Indian Maurya Empire, the Gupta Empire, the Arab Umayyad Caliphate, the Delhi Sultanate, the Mongol Empire, the Mughal Empire, the Afghan Durrani Empire, the Sikh Empire (partially) and, most recently, the British Indian Empire. \nPakistan is the only country to have been created in the name of Islam. \nIt is an ethnically and linguistically diverse country, with a similarly diverse geography and wildlife. \nInitially a dominion, Pakistan adopted a constitution in 1956, becoming an Islamic republic. \nAn ethnic civil war and Indian military intervention in 1971 resulted in the secession of East Pakistan as the new country of Bangladesh.

      "\n\nHistory of Ireland: Linguists realised from the 17th century onwards that the language spoken by these people, the Goidelic languages, was a branch of the Celtic languages. This is usually explained as a result of invasions by Celts from the continent. However, other research has postulated that the culture developed gradually and continuously, and that the introduction of Celtic language and elements of Celtic culture may have been a result of cultural exchange with Celtic groups in southwest continental Europe from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.The hypothesis that the native Late Bronze Age inhabitants gradually absorbed Celtic influences has since been supported by some recent genetic research.The Romans referred to Ireland as Scotia 500 CE, and later Hibernia. Ptolemy, in 100 CE, recorded Ireland's geography and tribes. Ireland was never a part of the Roman Empire, but Roman influence was often projected well beyond its borders. Tacitus writes that an exiled Irish prince was with Agricola in Roman Britain and would return to seize power in Ireland. Juvenal tells us that Roman \"arms had been taken beyond the shores of Ireland\". In recent years, some experts have hypothesized that Roman-sponsored Gaelic forces (or perhaps even Roman regulars) mounted some kind of invasion around 100 CE, but the exact relationship between Rome and the dynasties and peoples of Hibernia remains unclear."

      "\n\nOvarian cyst: An ovarian cyst is a fluid-filled sac within the ovary. \nOften they cause no symptoms. \nOccasionally they may produce bloating, lower abdominal pain, or lower back pain. \nThe majority of cysts are harmless. \nIf the cyst either breaks open or causes twisting of the ovary, it may cause severe pain. \nThis may result in vomiting or feeling faint.Most ovarian cysts are related to ovulation, being either follicular cysts or corpus luteum cysts. \nOther types include cysts due to endometriosis, dermoid cysts, and cystadenomas. \nMany small cysts occur in both ovaries in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). \nPelvic inflammatory disease may also result in cysts. \nRarely, cysts may be a form of ovarian cancer. \nDiagnosis is undertaken by pelvic examination with an ultrasound or other testing used to gather further details.Often, cysts are simply observed over time. \nIf they cause pain, medications such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen may be used. \nHormonal birth control may be used to prevent further cysts in those who are frequently affected. \nHowever, evidence does not support birth control as a treatment of current cysts. \nIf they do not go away after several months, get larger, look unusual, or cause pain, they may be removed by surgery.Most women of reproductive age develop small cysts each month. \nLarge cysts that cause problems occur in about 8% of women before menopause.

    "response": "La depreciaci√≥n de una moneda puede ocurrir por varios factores econ√≥micos y financieros, incluyendo:\n\n1. **Inflaci√≥n alta**: Si un pa√≠s experimenta inflaci√≥n elevada, el valor de su moneda disminuye frente a otras monedas, ya que los bienes y servicios se vuelven m√°s caros.\n\n2. **Tasas de inter√©s bajas**: Monedas con tasas de inter√©s m√°s altas suelen atraer inversiones extranjeras, fortaleciendo su valor. Si una moneda tiene tasas bajas, puede depreciarse al compararse con monedas con mayores rendimientos.\n\n3. **D√©ficit comercial**: Si un pa√≠s importa m√°s de lo que exporta, puede necesitar m√°s divisas extranjeras para cubrir sus compras, lo que presiona a la depreciaci√≥n de su moneda.\n\n4. **Deuda externa elevada**: Pa√≠ses con altas deudas en moneda extranjera pueden ver su moneda depreciarse si no pueden cubrir sus obligaciones.\n\n5. **Inestabilidad pol√≠tica o econ√≥mica**: Conflictos, crisis gubernamentales o incertidumbre econ√≥mica pueden reducir la confianza de los inversores, provocando una salida de capitales y depreciaci√≥n.\n\n6. **Intervenci√≥n de bancos centrales**: Si un banco central vende su moneda en el mercado cambiario para estabilizarla, puede generar presi√≥n a la depreciaci√≥n si no hay suficiente demanda.\n\n7. **Expectativas de mercado**: La especulaci√≥n o expectativas negativas sobre el futuro de una econom√≠a pueden provocar una depreciaci√≥n anticipada.\n\n**Ejemplo**: Si Estados Unidos reduce sus tasas de inter√©s mientras Europa las mantiene altas, el d√≥lar podr√≠a depreciarse frente al euro, ya que los inversionistas buscan mayores rendimientos en la moneda europea. \n\nEstos factores suelen interactuar, y la depreciaci√≥n puede ser el resultado de una combinaci√≥n de ellos.",

      "\n\nFrench colonial empire: In the middle of the 18th century, a series of colonial conflicts began between France and Britain, which ultimately resulted in the destruction of most of the first French colonial empire and the near-complete expulsion of France from the Americas. These wars were the War of the Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì1748), the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763), the American Revolution (1765‚Äì1783), the French Revolutionary Wars (1793‚Äì1802) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803‚Äì1815). It may even be seen further back in time to the first of the French and Indian Wars. This cyclic conflict is sometimes known as the Second Hundred Years' War. The French colonial empire began to fall during the Second World War, when various parts were occupied by foreign powers (Japan in Indochina, Britain in Syria, Lebanon, and Madagascar, the United States and Britain in Morocco and Algeria, and Germany and Italy in Tunisia). However, control was gradually reestablished by Charles de Gaulle. The French Union, included in the Constitution of 1946, nominally replaced the former colonial empire, but officials in Paris remained in full control.

      "\n\nAnt-Man: Ant-Man is the name of several fictional superheroes appearing in books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby, Ant-Man's first appearance was in Tales to Astonish #35 (September 1962). The persona was originally the brilliant scientist Hank Pym's superhero alias after inventing a substance that can change size, but Scott Lang and Eric O'Grady also took on the mantle after the original changed his superhero identity to various other aliases, such as Giant-Man, Goliath, and Yellowjacket. Scott Lang was a thief who became Ant-Man after stealing the Ant-Man suit to save his daughter Cassandra \"Cassie\" Lang from a heart condition. Reforming from his life of crime, Lang soon took on a full-time career as Ant-Man with the encouragement of Hank Pym.

The Milky Way Galaxy, where our own Solar System is located, is classified as a barred spiral galaxy.Edwin Hubble classified spiral galaxies of this type as \"SB\" (spiral, barred) in his Hubble sequence and arranged them into sub-categories based on how open the arms of the spiral are. SBa types feature tightly bound arms, while SBc types are at the other extreme and have loosely bound arms. SBb-type galaxies lie in between the two. SB0 is a barred lenticular galaxy. A new type, SBm, was subsequently created to describe somewhat irregular barred spirals, such as the Magellanic Clouds, which were once classified as irregular galaxies, but have since been found to contain barred spiral structures.

      "\n\nHistory of Singapore: After the Japanese surrender to the Allies on 15 August 1945, Singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder; looting and revenge-killing were widespread. \nBritish troops led by Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander for Southeast Asia Command, returned to Singapore to receive formal surrender of the Japanese forces in the region from General Itagaki Seishiro on behalf of General Hisaichi Terauchi on 12 September 1945, and a British Military Administration was formed to govern the island until March 1946. \nMuch of the infrastructure had been destroyed during the war, including electricity and water supply systems, telephone services, as well as the harbor facilities at the Port of Singapore. \nThere was also a shortage of food leading to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. \nHigh food prices, unemployment, and workers' discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services. \nBy late 1947, the economy began to recover, facilitated by a growing demand for tin and rubber around the world, but it would take several more years before the economy returned to pre-war levels.The failure of Britain to defend Singapore had destroyed its credibility as infallible ruler in the eyes of Singaporeans. \nThe decades after the war saw a political awakening amongst the local populace and the rise of anti-colonial and nationalist sentiments, epitomized by the slogan Merdeka, or \"independence\" in the Malay language. ",
      "\n\nThe British, on their part, were prepared to gradually increase self-governance for Singapore and Malaya. \nOn 1 April 1946, the Straits Settlements was dissolved and Singapore became a separate Crown Colony with a civil administration headed by a Governor. \nIn July 1947, separate Executive and Legislative Councils were established and the election of six members of the Legislative Council was scheduled in the following year. \nDavid Marshall, leader of the Labour Front, became the first Chief Minister of Singapore. \nHe presided over a shaky government, receiving little cooperation from either the colonial government or the other local parties. \nSocial unrest was on the rise, and in May 1955, the Hock Lee bus riots broke out, killing four people and seriously discrediting Marshall's government. \nIn 1956, the Chinese middle school riots broke out among students in The Chinese High School and other schools, further increasing the tension between the local government and the Chinese students and unionists who were regarded of having communist sympathies. \nDuring World War 2, Singapore was conquered and occupied by the Japanese Empire from 1942 to 1945. \nWhen the war ended, Singapore reverted to British control, with increasing levels of self-government being granted, culminating in Singapore's merger with the Federation of Malaya to form Malaysia in 1963. \nHowever, social unrest and disputes between Singapore's ruling People's Action Party and Malaysia's Alliance Party resulted in Singapore's expulsion from Malaysia. \nSingapore became an independent republic on 9 August 1965. ",
      "\n\nThe proliferation of squatter settlements resulted in safety hazards and caused the Bukit Ho Swee Fire in 1961 that killed four people and left 16,000 others homeless. \nThe Housing Development Board set up before independence continued to be largely successful and huge building projects sprung up to provide affordable public housing to resettle the squatters. \nWithin a decade, the majority of the population had been housed in these apartments. \nThe Central Provident Fund (CPF) Housing Scheme, introduced in 1968, allows residents to use their compulsory savings account to purchase HDB flats and gradually increases home ownership in Singapore.British troops had remained in Singapore following its independence, but in 1968, London announced its decision to withdraw the forces by 1971. \nWith the secret aid of military advisers from Israel, Singapore rapidly established the Singapore Armed Forces, with the help of a national service program introduced in 1967. \nSince independence, Singaporean defense spending has been approximately five percent of GDP.  \nToday, the Singapore Armed Forces are among the best-equipped in Asia. \nThe status of a British outpost in Singapore seemed initially in doubt as the Dutch government soon protested to Britain for violating the Netherlands' sphere of influence. \nBut as Singapore rapidly emerged as an important trading post, Britain consolidated its claim on the island.

      "\n\nLength contraction: Heavy ions that are spherical when at rest should assume the form of \"pancakes\" or flat disks when traveling nearly at the speed of light. And in fact, the results obtained from particle collisions can only be explained when the increased nucleon density due to length contraction is considered. It was the negative result of a famous experiment, that required the introduction of length contraction: the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment (and later also the Kennedy‚ÄìThorndike experiment). In special relativity its explanation is as follows: In its rest frame the interferometer can be regarded as at rest in accordance with the relativity principle, so the propagation time of light is the same in all directions. Although in a frame in which the interferometer is in motion, the transverse beam must traverse a longer, diagonal path with respect to the non-moving frame thus making its travel time longer, the factor by which the longitudinal beam would be delayed by taking times L/(c-v) & L/(c+v) for the forward and reverse trips respectively is even longer. Therefore, in the longitudinal direction the interferometer is supposed to be contracted, in order to restore the equality of both travel times in accordance with the negative experimental result(s). Thus the two-way speed of light remains constant and the round trip propagation time along perpendicular arms of the interferometer is independent of its motion & orientation.",

Live Trace allows for the conversion of bitmap imagery into vector art and improved upon the previous tracing abilities. Live Paint allows users more flexibility in applying color to objects, specifically those that overlap. In the same year as the CS2 release, Adobe Systems announced an agreement to acquire Macromedia in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion and it integrated the companies' operations, networks, and customer-care organizations shortly thereafter.  Adobe now owned FreeHand along with the entire Macromedia product line and in 2007, Adobe announced that it would discontinue development and updates to the FreeHand program. Instead, Adobe would provide tools and support to ease the transition to Illustrator.CS3 included interface updates to the Control Bar, the ability to align individual points, multiple Crop Areas, the Color Guide panel and the Live Color feature among others.

Recent scholarship has yielded a more comprehensive view of Mary Shelley's achievements. Scholars have shown increasing interest in her literary output, particularly in her novels, which include the historical novels Valperga (1823) and Perkin Warbeck (1830), the apocalyptic novel The Last Man (1826), and her final two novels, Lodore (1835) and Falkner (1837). Studies of her lesser-known works, such as the travel book Rambles in Germany and Italy (1844) and the biographical articles for Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia (1829‚Äì1846), support the growing view that Mary Shelley remained a political radical throughout her life. Mary Shelley's works often argue that cooperation and sympathy, particularly as practised by women in the family, were the ways to reform civil society. This view was a direct challenge to the individualistic Romantic ethos promoted by Percy Shelley and the Enlightenment political theories articulated by her father, William Godwin."

Infections related to swimming pools have now drastically fallen due to the improvements in the construction and maintenance of these facilities.The first case of M. marinum infection associated with a fish-tank ('fish-tank granuloma') was reported in 1962 by Swift and Cohen. M. marinum infection may be an occupational hazard for certain professions such as pet shop workers, but most infections occur in fish fanciers who keep an aquarium at home. Although infection may be caused by direct injury from the fish fins or bites, most are acquired during the handling of the aquariums such as cleaning or changing the water.

He died in 197 BC, shortly before the end of the second war, at the age of 72, having suffered an apparent stroke while addressing a Boeotian war council some months before. He and his wife were admired for their rearing of their four sons. He was succeeded as king by his son Eumenes II. Attalus won an important victory over the Galatians, newly arrived Celtic tribes from Thrace, who had been, for more than a generation, plundering and exacting tribute throughout most of Asia Minor without any serious check. This victory, celebrated by the triumphal monument at Pergamon (famous for its Dying Gaul) and the liberation from the Gallic \"terror\" which it represented, earned for Attalus the name of \"Soter\", and the title of \"king\". A courageous and capable general and loyal ally of Rome, he played a significant role in the first and second Macedonian Wars, waged against Philip V of Macedon. He conducted numerous naval operations, harassing Macedonian interests throughout the Aegean, winning honors, collecting spoils, and gaining for Pergamon possession of the Greek islands of Aegina during the first war, and Andros during the second, twice narrowly escaping capture at the hands of Philip.",

      "\n\nThe A&AEE example was unarmed, lacked turbochargers and restricted to 300 mph (480 km/h); though the undercarriage was praised and flight on one engine described as comfortable. \nThese three were subsequently returned to the USAAF; one in December 1942 and the others in July 1943. \nOf the remaining 140 Lightning Is, 19 were not modified and were designated by the USAAF as RP-322-I ('R' for 'Restricted', because non-counter-rotating propellers were considered more dangerous on takeoff), while 121 were converted to non-turbo-supercharged counter-rotating V-1710F-2 engines and designated P-322-II. \nAll 121 were used as advanced trainers; a few were still serving that role in 1945. \nA few RP-322s were later used as test modification platforms such as for smoke-laying canisters. \nThe RP-322 was a fairly fast aircraft below 16,000 ft (4,900 m) and well-behaved as a trainer.One result of the failed British/French order was to give the aircraft its name. \nLockheed had originally dubbed the aircraft Atalanta from Greek mythology in the company tradition of naming planes after mythological and celestial figures, but the RAF name won out. \nThe P-38F was followed in early 1943 by the P-38G, using more powerful Allisons of 1,400 hp (1,000 kW) each and equipped with a better radio.

      "\n\nDue to reports the USAAF was receiving from Europe, the remaining 36 in the batch were upgraded with small improvements such as self-sealing fuel tanks and enhanced armor protection to make them combat-capable. \nThe USAAF specified that these 36 aircraft were to be designated P-38D. \nAs a result, there never were any P-38Bs or P-38Cs. \nThe P-38D's main role was to work out bugs and give the USAAF experience with handling the type.In March 1940, the French and the British, through the Anglo-French Purchasing Committee, ordered a total of 667 P-38s for US$100M, designated Model 322F for the French and Model 322B for the British. \nThe aircraft would be a variant of the P-38E. \nThe overseas Allies wished for complete commonality of Allison engines with the large numbers of Curtiss P-40 Tomahawks both nations had on order, and thus ordered the Model 322 twin right-handed engines instead of counter-rotating ones and without turbo-superchargers. \nPerformance was supposed to be 400 mph (640 km/h) at 16,900 ft (5,200 m). \nAfter the fall of France in June 1940, the British took over the entire order and gave the aircraft the service name \"Lightning.\" \nBy June 1941, the War Ministry had cause to reconsider their earlier aircraft specifications based on experience gathered in the Battle of Britain and The Blitz.

      "\n\nDemyansk Pocket: Between the forming of the pocket in early February to the abandonment of Demyansk in May, the two pockets (including Kholm) received 65,000 short tons (59,000 t) of supplies (both through ground and aerial delivery), 31,000 replacement troops, and 36,000 wounded were evacuated. The supplies were delivered through over 100 flights of whitewashed Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft per day. However, the cost was significant. The Luftwaffe lost 265 aircraft, including 106 Junkers Ju 52, 17 Heinkel He 111 and two Junkers Ju 86 aircraft. In addition, 387 airmen were lost. Richard Overy argues that the Demyansk airlift was a Pyrrhic victory, citing the loss of over 200 aircraft and their crew \"when annual production of transports was running at only 500; and all to save 90,000 German soldiers, 64,000 of whom were either killed, wounded or too sick for service\" by the airlift's end.Fighting in the area continued until 28 February 1943. The Soviet forces did not retake Demyansk until 1 March 1943, with the organized withdrawal of the German troops.",
