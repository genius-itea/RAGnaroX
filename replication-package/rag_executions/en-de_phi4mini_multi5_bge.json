      "\n\nNTSC: The National Television System Committee was established in 1940 by the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to resolve the conflicts between companies over the introduction of a nationwide analog television system in the United States. \nIn March 1941, the committee issued a technical standard for black-and-white television that built upon a 1936 recommendation made by the Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA). \nTechnical advancements of the vestigial side band technique allowed for the opportunity to increase the image resolution. \nThe NTSC selected 525 scan lines as a compromise between RCA's 441-scan line standard (already being used by RCA's NBC TV network) and Philco's and DuMont's desire to increase the number of scan lines to between 605 and 800. \nThe standard recommended a frame rate of 30 frames (images) per second, consisting of two interlaced fields per frame at 262.5 lines per field and 60 fields per second. \nOther standards in the final recommendation were an aspect ratio of 4:3, and frequency modulation (FM) for the sound signal (which was quite new at the time). \nThe actual figure of 525 lines was chosen as a consequence of the limitations of the vacuum-tube-based technologies of the day. \nIn early TV systems, a master voltage-controlled oscillator was run at twice the horizontal line frequency, and this frequency was divided down by the number of lines used (in this case 525) to give the field frequency (60 Hz in this case).

      "\n\nThis frequency was then compared with the 60 Hz power-line frequency and any discrepancy corrected by adjusting the frequency of the master oscillator. \nFor interlaced scanning, an odd number of lines per frame was required in order to make the vertical retrace distance identical for the odd and even fields, which meant the master oscillator frequency had to be divided down by an odd number."

      "\n\nHistory of chemistry: Around 420 BC, Empedocles stated that all matter is made up of four elemental substances: earth, fire, air and water. The early theory of atomism can be traced back to ancient Greece and ancient India. Greek atomism dates back to the Greek philosopher Democritus, who declared that matter is composed of indivisible and indestructible particles called \"atomos\" around 380 BC. Leucippus also declared that atoms were the most indivisible part of matter. This coincided with a similar declaration by Indian philosopher Kanada in his Vaisheshika sutras around the same time period. In much the same fashion he discussed the existence of gases. What Kanada declared by sutra, Democritus declared by philosophical musing. Both suffered from a lack of empirical data. Without scientific proof, the existence of atoms was easy to deny. Aristotle opposed the existence of atoms in 330 BC. Earlier, in 380 BC, a Greek text attributed to Polybus argued that the human body is composed of four humours. Around 300 BC, Epicurus postulated a universe of indestructible atoms in which man himself is responsible for achieving a balanced life.",

      "\n\nTernary computer: One early calculating machine, built by Thomas Fowler entirely from wood in 1840, operated in balanced ternary. \nThe first modern, electronic ternary computer Setun was built in 1958 in the Soviet Union at the Moscow State University by Nikolay Brusentsov, and it had notable advantages over the binary computers which eventually replaced it, such as lower electricity consumption and lower production cost. \nIn 1970 Brusentsov built an enhanced version of the computer, which he called Setun-70.  \nIn the USA, the ternary computing emulator Ternac working on a binary machine was developed in 1973.\nThe ternary computer QTC-1 was developed in Canada. \nWith the advent of mass-produced binary components for computers, ternary computers have diminished in significance. \nHowever, Donald Knuth argues that they will be brought back into development in the future to take advantage of ternary logic's elegance and efficiency. \nOne possible way this could happen is by combining an optical computer with the ternary logic system. \nA ternary computer using fiber optics could use dark as 0 and two orthogonal polarizations of light as 1 and −1. \nIBM also reports infrequently on ternary computing topics (in its papers), but it is not actively engaged in it.The Josephson junction has been proposed as a balanced ternary memory cell, using circulating superconducting currents, either clockwise, counterclockwise, or off.

Der Roman über Valentins Martyrergeschichte, in dem er sich Claudius II. gegenüber weigert, zum Christentum zu konvertieren, ist eine legendäre Erzählung. Claudius II. war ein römischer Kaiser, der keine historische Figur ist, die mit dem Heiligen Valentine, einem christlichen Märtyrer, in Verbindung gebracht wird. Die Geschichte, in der Valentine Claudius Christentum lehren möchte, ist eine Legende, die in der kirchlichen Literatur des Mittelalters verbreitet wurde. Claudius II. selbst war kein Christ und wird nicht als jemand dargestellt, der von Valentine bekehrt wurde. Die Erzählung über Valentines Bemühungen, Claudius zum Christentum zu konvertieren, ist Teil der romantisierten und legendären Tradition, die um den Heiligen Valentine herum entstanden ist.",

Hier sind einige Beispiele aus verschiedenen Ländern:\n\n1. **Vereinigte Staaten**: In den USA hat jede Präsidentschaft Maßnahmen ergriffen, die den Eisenbahnsektor beeinflusst haben. Zum Beispiel hat die Theodore Roosevelt-Präsidentschaft der Union Pacific Railroad (UP) 1906 eine Konzession erlassen, die den Bau der Lincoln Line erzwang, der den Transport von Kohle zwischen dem westlichen Kohlebergbau und dem Atlantischen Ozean erleichterte. Später, während der Präsidentschaft von Franklin D. Roosevelt, wurde 1940 die Streichung der monopolistischen Macht der Union Pacific und Southern Pacific Eisenbahngesellschaften genehmigt, um den Wettbewerb zu fördern.\n\n2. **Vereinigtes Königreich**: In England und Wales hat die Eisenbahnindustrie im Laufe der Geschichte eine Reihe von Privatisierungen erlebt. Die British Transport Commission wurde 1948 während der Herrschaft von Winston Churchill gegründet, um die Eisenbahnen, den Schienenverkehr und den Seeverkehr zu verwalten. Die British Railways wurden 1993 unter der Regierung von John Major privatisiert, und die Privatisierung wurde durch die Labour-Regierung von Tony Blair fortgesetzt, die den größten Teil des Systems 1997 privatisierte.\n\n3. **Frankreich**: Die Eisenbahnen in Frankreich, die Réseau électrique Parisian (REP), wurden 1938 unter der Regierung von Eduard Daladier privatisiert. Später gab es mehrere Versuche, die Eisenbahnen im Laufe der Jahre zu reformieren, einschließlich der Schaffung von SNCF (Société nationale des chemins de fer français), einem staatlichen Unternehmen, das im Jahr 1993 unter der Präsidentschaft von Jacques Chirac gegründet wurde.\n\n4. **Deutschland**: Die Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) und später die Deutsche Bahn AG (DB AG) haben im Laufe der Geschichte verschiedene Privatisierungs- und Reorganisationen durchlaufen. Die Privatisierung begann 1994 in der Regierung von Helmut Kohl, und die DB AG wurde 1995 gegründet, als die Deutsche Bahn AG.\n\n5. **Brasilien**: Die brasilianische Eisenbahngesellschaft (Brazilian National Railways) wurde 1999 privat verkauft, wobei der Staat 66% der Anteile verkaufte. Der Verkauf war Teil der Politik der Regierung von Fernando Henrique Cardoso, die die Privatisierung staatseigener Unternehmen anstrebte.\n\nDiese Beispiele zeigen, dass Präsidial- und Regierungsbehörden in verschiedenen Ländern verschiedene Maßnahmen ergriffen haben, um den Eisenbahnsektor zu beeinflussen, was manchmal als \"Verschiebung\" des Zugverkehrs interpretiert werden könnte. Es ist jedoch wichtig zu beachten, dass die spezifischen Maßnahmen und deren Auswirkungen je nach nationaler Politik, wirtschaftlichen Bedingungen und politischen Ideologien variieren können.",

During this period he investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum produced by a prism could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.He showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour. From 1978 until 1988, an image of Newton designed by Harry Ecclestone appeared on Series D £1 banknotes issued by the Bank of England (the last £1 notes to be issued by the Bank of England).

In late 2004, Chris Stone again left the company, after an apparent control issue with then CEO Jack Messman. In an effort to cut costs, Novell announced a round of layoffs in late 2005. While revenue from its Linux business continued to grow, the growth was not fast enough to offset the decrease in revenue of NetWare. While the company's revenue was not falling rapidly, it wasn't growing, either. Lack of clear direction or effective management meant that Novell took longer than expected to complete its restructuring. Novell based its network protocol on Xerox Network Systems (XNS), and created its own standards from IDP and SPP, which it named Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) and Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX). File and print services ran on the NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) over IPX, as did Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Service Advertising Protocol (SAP)."

      "\n\nIn February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising the Prince of Wales to act as regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons, but before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George III recovered. \nGeorge III hoped that \"the tongue of malice may not paint my intentions in those colours she admires, nor the sycophant extoll me beyond what I deserve\", but in the popular mind George III has been both demonised and praised. \nWhile very popular at the start of his reign, by the mid-1770s George had lost the loyalty of revolutionary American colonists, though it has been estimated that as many as half of the colonists remained loyal. \nThe grievances in the United States Declaration of Independence were presented as \"repeated injuries and usurpations\" that he had committed to establish an \"absolute Tyranny\" over the colonies. \nThe Declaration's wording has contributed to the American public's perception of George as a tyrant. \nContemporary accounts of George III's life fall into two camps: one demonstrating \"attitudes dominant in the latter part of the reign, when the King had become a revered symbol of national resistance to French ideas and French power\", while the other \"derived their views of the King from the bitter partisan strife of the first two decades of the reign, and they expressed in their works the views of the opposition\".",
      "\n\nBuilding on the latter of these two assessments, British historians of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as Trevelyan and Erskine May, promoted hostile interpretations of George III's life. \nHowever, in the mid-twentieth century the work of Lewis Namier, who thought George was \"much maligned\", started a re-evaluation of the man and his reign. \nScholars of the later twentieth century, such as Butterfield and Pares, and Macalpine and Hunter, are inclined to treat George sympathetically, seeing him as a victim of circumstance and illness. \nButterfield rejected the arguments of his Victorian predecessors with withering disdain: \"Erskine May must be a good example of the way in which an historian may fall into error through an excess of brilliance. \nHis capacity for synthesis, and his ability to dovetail the various parts of the evidence ... carried him into a more profound and complicated elaboration of error than some of his more pedestrian predecessors ... he inserted a doctrinal element into his history which, granted his original aberrations, was calculated to project the lines of his error, carrying his work still further from centrality or truth.\" \nIn pursuing war with the American colonists, George III believed he was defending the right of an elected Parliament to levy taxes, rather than seeking to expand his own power or prerogatives. ",
      "\n\nGeorge III of the United Kingdom: A brief lull in hostilities allowed Pitt to concentrate effort on Ireland, where there had been an uprising and attempted French landing in 1798. \nIn 1800, the British and Irish Parliaments passed an Act of Union that took effect on 1 January 1801 and united Great Britain and Ireland into a single state, known as the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\". \nGeorge used the opportunity to abandon the title \"king of France\", which English and British Sovereigns had maintained since the reign of Edward III. \nIt was suggested that George adopt the title \"Emperor of the British Isles\", but he refused. \nAs part of his Irish policy, Pitt planned to remove certain legal disabilities that applied to Roman Catholics. \nGeorge III claimed that to emancipate Catholics would be to violate his coronation oath, in which Sovereigns promise to maintain Protestantism. \nFaced with opposition to his religious reform policies from both the King and the British public, Pitt threatened to resign. \nAt about the same time, the King had a relapse of his previous illness, which he blamed on worry over the Catholic question. \nOn 14 March 1801, Pitt was formally replaced by the Speaker of the House of Commons, Henry Addington. \nAddington opposed emancipation, instituted annual accounts, abolished income tax and began a programme of disarmament. \nIn October 1801, he made peace with the French, and in 1802 signed the Treaty of Amiens.George did not consider the peace with France as real; in his view it was an \"experiment\".

    "response": "King George III verlor im Laufe seiner Herrschaft zunehmend das Vertrauen der amerikanischen Kolonisten, insbesondere als die Spannungen zwischen den Kolonien und dem britischen Regierung zu eskalieren begannen. Ein entscheidender Moment war die Annahme des Townshend Acts im Jahr 1767, der Zölle auf mehrere Waren einführte, die in die Kolonien importiert wurden, darunter Kerzen, Zucker, Wein und Kleidung. Die Kolonisten betrachteten diese Steuern als ungerecht, weil sie von der Kolonialversammlung ohne Vertretung durch das Parlament in Großbritannien verabschiedet wurden, was den Ausdruck \"kein Steuer ohne Vertretung\" verstärkte.\n\nDer Konflikt eskalierte weiter mit der Einführung des Stamp Act von 1765, der die erste direkte Steuer auf die Kolonien einführte, um die Kriegskosten zu decken, die durch den Siebenjährigen Krieg verursacht wurden. Die Kolonisten reagierten mit Protesten, und der Stamp Act wurde 1766 aufgehoben.\n\nDie Situation verschlechterte sich weiter, als King George III und seine Minister versuchten, die rebellischen Kolonien zu unterdrücken. Die Boston Tea Party im Jahr 1773, bei der die Einheimischen das Teevolumen der britischen East India Company als Protest gegen die Tea Act stürzten, führte zu strengen Repressalien, die den Intolerable Acts oder den Ungehinderten Handel-Gesetzen von 1774 genannt wurden. Diese Gesetze waren darauf ausgelegt, die Kontrolle über die Kolonien zu erlangen, indem sie die Autonomie der lokalen Versammlungen einschränkten und die Rechtsprechung in Boston verstärkten.\n\nDer Konflikt erreichte seinen Höhepunkt im April 1775 mit den Schlachten von Lexington und Concord, die als Beginn des amerikanischen Unabhängigkeitskrieges angesehen werden. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt hatte King George III das Vertrauen der amerikanischen Kolonisten weitgehend verloren, und die Kolonien begannen, ihre Unabhängigkeit zu fordern, die schließlich im Juli 1776 mit der Annahme der Unabhängigkeitserklärung formalisiert wurde.\n\nDaher kann man sagen, dass King George III das Vertrauen der amerikanischen Kolonisten im Verlauf seiner gesamten Herrschaft verloren hat, aber der entscheidende Moment, an dem das Vertrauen vollständig verloren ging, war nach der Annahme der Unabhängigkeitserklärung im Jahr 1776, als die Kolonien ihre Unabhängigkeit erklärten und sich von der britischen Herrschaft lösten.",

      "\n\nHe told Adams, \"I was the last to consent to the separation; but the separation having been made and having become inevitable, I have always said, as I say now, that I would be the first to meet the friendship of the United States as an independent power.\" \nGeorge III lived for 81 years and 239 days and reigned for 59 years and 96 days: both his life and his reign were longer than those of any of his predecessors and subsequent kings. \nOnly Queens Victoria and Elizabeth II have since lived and reigned longer. \nGeorge was born in London at Norfolk House in St James's Square. \nHe was the grandson of King George II, and the eldest son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. \nAs he was born two months prematurely and thought unlikely to survive, he was baptised the same day by Thomas Secker, who was both Rector of St James's and Bishop of Oxford. \nGeorge was deeply devout and spent hours in prayer, but his piety was not shared by his brothers. \nGeorge was appalled by what he saw as their loose morals. \nIn 1770, his brother Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, was exposed as an adulterer, and the following year Cumberland married a young widow, Anne Horton. \nThe King considered her inappropriate as a royal bride: she was from a lower social class and German law barred any children of the couple from the Hanoverian succession. ",
      "\n\nIn the opinion of modern scholars, during the long reign of George III the monarchy continued to lose its political power, and grew as the embodiment of national morality. \nGeorge III is often accused of obstinately trying to keep Great Britain at war with the revolutionaries in America, despite the opinions of his own ministers. \nIn the words of the Victorian author George Trevelyan, the King was determined \"never to acknowledge the independence of the Americans, and to punish their contumacy by the indefinite prolongation of a war which promised to be eternal.\" \nThe King wanted to \"keep the rebels harassed, anxious, and poor, until the day when, by a natural and inevitable process, discontent and disappointment were converted into penitence and remorse\". \nHowever, more recent historians defend George by saying in the context of the times no king would willingly surrender such a large territory, and his conduct was far less ruthless than contemporary monarchs in Europe. \nAfter Saratoga, both Parliament and the British people were in favour of the war; recruitment ran at high levels and although political opponents were vocal, they remained a small minority. \nWith the setbacks in America, Prime Minister Lord North asked to transfer power to Lord Chatham, whom he thought more capable, but George refused to do so; he suggested instead that Chatham serve as a subordinate minister in Lord North's administration, but Chatham refused to co-operate. \nHe died later in the same year. ",
      "\n\nAt age 10, George took part in a family production of Joseph Addison's play Cato and said in the new prologue: \"What, tho' a boy! \nIt may with truth be said, A boy in England born, in England bred.\" \nHistorian Romney Sedgwick argued that these lines appear \"to be the source of the only historical phrase with which he is associated\".\nGeorge's grandfather, King George II, disliked the Prince of Wales, and took little interest in his grandchildren. \nHowever, in 1751 the Prince of Wales died unexpectedly from a lung injury at the age of 44, and George became heir apparent to the throne. \nHe inherited his father's title of Duke of Edinburgh. \nNow more interested in his grandson, three weeks later the king created George Prince of Wales (the title is not automatically acquired). \nWith the collapse of Lord North's ministry in 1782, the Whig Lord Rockingham became Prime Minister for the second time, but died within months. \nThe King then appointed Lord Shelburne to replace him. \nCharles James Fox, however, refused to serve under Shelburne, and demanded the appointment of the Duke of Portland. \nIn 1783, the House of Commons forced Shelburne from office and his government was replaced by the Fox–North Coalition. \nThe Duke of Portland became Prime Minister, with Fox and Lord North, as Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary respectively."

",
      "\n\nBuilding on the latter of these two assessments, British historians of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as Trevelyan and Erskine May, promoted hostile interpretations of George III's life. \nHowever, in the mid-twentieth century the work of Lewis Namier, who thought George was \"much maligned\", started a re-evaluation of the man and his reign. \nScholars of the later twentieth century, such as Butterfield and Pares, and Macalpine and Hunter, are inclined to treat George sympathetically, seeing him as a victim of circumstance and illness. \nButterfield rejected the arguments of his Victorian predecessors with withering disdain: \"Erskine May must be a good example of the way in which an historian may fall into error through an excess of brilliance. \nHis capacity for synthesis, and his ability to dovetail the various parts of the evidence ... carried him into a more profound and complicated elaboration of error than some of his more pedestrian predecessors ... he inserted a doctrinal element into his history which, granted his original aberrations, was calculated to project the lines of his error, carrying his work still further from centrality or truth.\" \nIn pursuing war with the American colonists, George III believed he was defending the right of an elected Parliament to levy taxes, rather than seeking to expand his own power or prerogatives. ",
      "\n\nGeorge III was buried on 16 February in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.George was succeeded by two of his sons, George IV and William IV, who both died without surviving legitimate children, leaving the throne to the only legitimate child of the Duke of Kent, Victoria, the last monarch of the House of Hanover. \nOne month later, he was publicly baptised at Norfolk House, again by Secker. \nHis godparents were the King of Sweden (for whom Lord Baltimore stood proxy), his uncle the Duke of Saxe-Gotha (for whom Lord Carnarvon stood proxy) and his great-aunt the Queen of Prussia (for whom Lady Charlotte Edwin stood proxy).\nPrince George grew into a healthy but reserved and shy child. \nThe family moved to Leicester Square, where George and his younger brother Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany, were educated together by private tutors. \nFamily letters show that he could read and write in both English and German, as well as comment on political events of the time, by the age of eight. \nHe was the first British monarch to study science systematically. \nApart from chemistry and physics, his lessons included astronomy, mathematics, French, Latin, history, music, geography, commerce, agriculture and constitutional law, along with sporting and social accomplishments such as dancing, fencing, and riding. \nHis religious education was wholly Anglican.

      "\n\nThe Avengers (2012 film): Ideas for a film based on the Avengers began in 2003, with Avi Arad, the CEO of Marvel Studios, first announcing plans to develop the film in April 2005, after Marvel Enterprises declared independence by allying with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures. \nMarvel discussed their plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts; the studio's intention was to release individual films for the main characters—to establish their identities and familiarize audiences with them—before merging the characters together in a crossover film. \nScreenwriter Zak Penn, who wrote The Incredible Hulk (2008), became attached to the film in 2006, and was hired by Marvel Studios to write the film in June 2007. \nIn the wake of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, Marvel negotiated with the Writers Guild of America to ensure that it could create films based on its comic book counterparts, including Captain America, Ant-Man and The Avengers. \nAfter the successful release of Iron Man (2008) in May, the company set a July 2011 release date for The Avengers. \nIn September 2008, Marvel Studios reached an agreement with Paramount—an extension of a previous partnership—which gave the company distribution rights for five future Marvel films.Casting began in October 2008 with Downey's signing. \nThough Don Cheadle was also reported to be reprising his Iron Man 2 role of War Machine for The Avengers, he later stated that he did not think the character would appear in the film.

As of September 2011, it had nearly regained the loss suffered during the 2008 recession. It was worth $32 billion in 2011, up from $28 billion in September 2010 and $26 billion in 2009. It suffered about 30% loss in 2008–2009. In December 2008, Harvard announced that its endowment had lost 22% (approximately $8 billion) from July to October 2008, necessitating budget cuts. Later reports suggest the loss was actually more than double that figure, a reduction of nearly 50% of its endowment in the first four months alone. Forbes in March 2009 estimated the loss to be in the range of $12 billion. One of the most visible results of Harvard's attempt to re-balance its budget was their halting of construction of the $1.2 billion Allston Science Complex that had been scheduled to be completed by 2011, resulting in protests from local residents. As of 2012, Harvard University had a total financial aid reserve of $159 million for students, and a Pell Grant reserve of $4.093 million available for disbursement.

Persische Expedition von 1796: Während Zubov's Truppen im Iran einfielen, könnten viele Iraner Angst, Angst und Frustration gefühlt haben. Die Situation wurde noch verschärft, als die russische Kaiserin Katharina die Große starb und ihr Nachfolger Paul I. die Truppen befahl, nach Russland zurückzukehren. Dies könnte die Emotionen der Iraner weiter aufgewühlt haben, da sie sich möglicherweise in der Hoffnung auf einen Sieg gegen die russischen Invasoren befunden hatten, der ihnen nun genommen wurde.

Operation Ramadan (Operation Khouzestan): Im Jahr 1980 warf die Invasion des Iraks unter Saddam Hussein in den Iran einen großen Schatten über das Land, was zu einem langen und blutigen Konflikt führte. Die anfänglichen Erfolge der irakischen Streitkräfte hätten für einige Iraner möglicherweise Hoffnung gegeben, aber die Schwere der Kämpfe, die Zerstörung und die Opfer, die die Operation erforderten, hätten Angst, Trauer und Wut bei der iranischen Bevölkerung verursacht. Die anfängliche Euphoria, als der Irak fast vollständig aus dem iranischen Territorium verdrängt wurde, wurde durch den Ausbruch des Iran-Irak-Kriegs (1980-1988) unterbrochen, der enorme menschliche und materielle Kosten für Iran mit sich brachte. Die Belagerung von Kerbela und die Schwere der Schlacht von Khorramshahr, die in den Texten erwähnt wird, hätten tiefe Trauer und Entsetzen ausgelöst.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass die Gefühle der iranischen Bevölkerung während dieser Zeiten stark von der politischen und sozialen Landschaft, individuellen Erfahrungen und Berichterstattung durch Medien beeinflusst wurden, die zugänglich waren.

Scholars have shown increasing interest in her literary output, particularly in her novels, which include the historical novels Valperga (1823) and Perkin Warbeck (1830), the apocalyptic novel The Last Man (1826), and her final two novels, Lodore (1835) and Falkner (1837). Studies of her lesser-known works, such as the travel book Rambles in Germany and Italy (1844) and the biographical articles for Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia (1829–1846), support the growing view that Mary Shelley remained a political radical throughout her life. Mary Shelley's works often argue that cooperation and sympathy, particularly as practised by women in the family, were the ways to reform civil society. This view was a direct challenge to the individualistic Romantic ethos promoted by Percy Shelley and the Enlightenment political theories articulated by her father, William Godwin.",

      "\n\nThese range from MMORPG to first-person shooters, from role-playing video games to online gambling. \nThis has revolutionized the way many people interact and spend their free time on the Internet. \nThe Internet has created social network services, forums of social interaction and social relations, such as Facebook, MySpace, Meetup, and CouchSurfing which facilitate both online and offline interaction. \nThe Internet is a relatively new phenomenon. \nAs Robert Darnton wrote, it is a revolutionary change that \"took place yesterday, or the day before, depending on how you measure it.\" \nThe Internet developed from the ARPANET, dating back to 1969; as a term it was coined in 1974. \nThe World Wide Web as we know it was shaped in the mid-1990s, when graphical interface and services like email became popular and reached wider (non-scientific and non-military) audiences and commerce. \nInternet Explorer was first released in 1995; Netscape a year earlier. \nGoogle was founded in 1998. \nWikipedia was founded in 2001. \nFacebook, MySpace, and YouTube in the mid-2000s. \nWeb 2.0 is still emerging. \nThe amount of information available on the net and the number of Internet users worldwide has continued to grow rapidly. \nThe term 'digital sociology' is now becoming increasingly used to denote new directions in sociological research into digital technologies since Web 2.0.",
      "\n\nWorld Wide Web: the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).The World Wide Web had several differences from other hypertext systems available at the time. The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of link rot. Unlike predecessors such as HyperCard, the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due. Coming two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the Gopher protocol was no longer free to use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and towards the Web. An early popular web browser was ViolaWWW for Unix and the X Window System.",
      "\n\nSociology of the Internet: A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy is the use of peer-to-peer lending for charitable purposes. \nKiva pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding. \nKiva raises funds for local intermediary microfinance organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. \nLenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. \nKiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves. \nHowever, the recent spread of cheap Internet access in developing countries has made genuine peer-to-peer connections increasingly feasible. \nIn 2009 the US-based nonprofit Zidisha tapped into this trend to offer the first peer-to-peer microlending platform to link lenders and borrowers across international borders without local intermediaries. \nInspired by interactive websites such as Facebook and eBay, Zidisha's microlending platform facilitates direct dialogue between lenders and borrowers and a performance rating system for borrowers. \nWeb users worldwide can fund loans for as little as a dollar. \nOne area of leisure on the Internet is online gaming. \nThis form of leisure creates communities, bringing people of all ages and origins to enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games.

    "reference": "aged to maturity",
    "response": "Die Entflammbarkeit in Baumgruppen, insbesondere in der Forstwirtschaft, ist ein kritisches Thema zur Sicherstellung der Sicherheit und Minimierung des Schadens durch Brände. Es gibt mehrere Faktoren, die die Entflammbarkeit von Baumgruppen erhöhen können:\n\n1. **Baumart und -alter**: Einige Baumarten sind intrinsisch entflammbarer als andere. Zum Beispiel sind Kiefer, Esche und Eiche in bestimmten Feuermustern (z.B. Feuerlinie) entflammbar, was bedeutet, dass sie leicht Feuer fangen können. Das Alter der Bäume spielt ebenfalls eine Rolle; jüngere, jüngere Bäume neigen dazu, leichter zu entflammbar als ältere, ausgereiftere Bäume zu sein, da sie mehr Feuchtigkeit und weniger brennbare Materialien wie trockene Holzfasern enthalten.\n\n2. **Baumgesundheit**: Bäume, die Stress ausgesetzt sind, wie Mangelernährung, Krankheiten oder Schädlinge, können anfälliger für Entflammung sein. Dies liegt daran, dass sie möglicherweise weniger Widerstandsfähigkeit gegen Brände aufweisen und leichter brennen.\n\n3. **Baumdichte**: Eng bewachsene Baumgruppen können Brände schneller verbreiten, da Feuer leichter zwischen den Bäumen überfliegen kann. Eine größere Distanz zwischen den Bäumen kann die Entflammungseffekte verringern, indem die Brände eingeschränkt werden.\n\n4. **Feuermuster und -intensität**: Das Muster des Feuers und die Intensität, mit der es brennt, können die Entflammbarkeit von Baumgruppen beeinflussen. Zum Beispiel können Feuer, die mit höherer Intensität und schnellerer Rate brennen, entflammbarere Baumgruppen schneller auslöschen.\n\n5. **Feuchtigkeitsgehalt**: Die Bodenfeuchtigkeit und die Feuchtigkeit innerhalb der Baumstrukturen können die Entflammbarkeit beeinflussen. Niedrigere Feuchtigkeitswerte können dazu führen, dass Bäume trockener sind und somit leichter entflammbar sind.\n\n6. **Umgebung und Bodenbeschaffenheit**: Die Art der Bodenoberfläche, die Vegetation in der Nähe und die topographischen Merkmale können die Verbreitung und Intensität von Bränden beeinflussen. Steile Hänge können beispielsweise Feuer schneller zum Himmel bringen und die Verbreitung in Baumgruppen begünstigen.\n\n7. **Menschenhandlung**: Der menschliche Einfluss, wie z.B. das Vernichten von Bränden, das Abbrennen von Gras und Heu, oder unkontrollierte Lagerung von Feuerwerk, kann die Entflammbarkeit von Baumgruppen erhöhen.\n\n8. **Vorhandensein und Qualität von Feuermarken**: Die Verwendung von Baumschutzmarken (Feuermarken), die für die Art des Baums und die spezifischen Brändeinsatzbedingungen geeignet sind, kann die Entflammbarkeit verringern. Die Qualität und Wirksamkeit dieser Markierungen ist entscheidend.\n\n9. **Vorherige Brände**: Historische Feuer in einer Region können die Entflammbarkeit von Baumgruppen beeinflussen. Die regenerationsbedingten Veränderungen in der Vegetation und mögliche Änderungen in der Bodenstruktur können die Brändechancen und -intensität in nachfolgenden Bränden beeinflussen.\n\n10. **Wachstumsbedingungen**: Wetterbedingungen wie Trockenheit und Temperatur können die Entflammbarkeit von Baumgruppen erhöhen. Dürreperioden können dazu führen, dass Bäume trockener sind und mehr brennbare Materialien enthalten.\n\nUm die Entflammbarkeit in Baumgruppen zu mindern, werden Forstwirte und Brandwächter Strategien wie die Restauration von Feuermarken, die Entfernung von brennbaren Materialien, die Schaffung Feuerwellen und die Planung von kontrollierten Verbrennungen sowie das Anpflanzen widerstandsfähiger Baumarten und die Reduzierung der Baumdichte verwendet. Es ist wichtig, ein umfassendes Verständnis aller relevanten Faktoren zu haben, um die Brandrisiken effektiv zu verwalten und zu minimieren.",

    "response": "Der Zweck von kontrollierten Bränden, auch als kontrollierte Verbrennungen, kontrollierte Feuer oder Brennmanagement bekannt, besteht darin, Vegetation, Laub und andere organische Materialien in einer kontrollierten Umgebung zu verbrennen, um verschiedene ökologische, landwirtschaftliche und umweltbezogene Probleme zu adressieren. Hier sind einige Hauptzwecke:\n\n1. Schädlingsbekämpfung: Kontrollierte Brände können natürliche Schädlingspopulationen, wie Insekten und Nagetiere, reduzieren, indem sie ihr Lebensraum zerstört werden. Dies kann die Notwendigkeit für chemische Schädlingsbekämpfungsmittel verringern.\n\n2. Bodengesundheit verbessern: Regelmäßige kontrollierte Brände können den Boden für das Pflanzenwachstum verbessern, indem sie abgestorbene Pflanzenmaterialien verbrennen, die im Laufe der Zeit Nährstoffe binden, die im Boden hindurchwandern können.\n\n3. Invasive Arten kontrollieren: Durch das Verbrennen invasiver Pflanzen können kontrollierte Brände deren Verbreitung auf kontrollierte Gebiete begrenzen, die sie verdrängen und die Vielfalt der einheimischen Arten schützen.\n\n4. Brände reduzieren: Durch die Durchführung kontrollierter Brände können Feuerrisiken reduziert werden, indem die Überreste von Laub und anderen brennbaren Materialien, die Brände auslösen könnten, entfernt werden.\n\n5. Ökosystemen helfen: Einige Ökosysteme, wie bestimmte Savannen- oder Buschlandökosysteme, sind von natürlichen Bränden abhängig. Kontrollierte Brände können helfen, diese Ökosysteme zu erhalten und ihre biologische Vielfalt zu unterstützen.\n\n6. Landwirtschaft: Auf landwirtschaftlichen Flächen können kontrollierte Brände dazu beitragen, die Bodentextur zu verbessern, Stickstoffgehalte zu erhöhen und das Wachstum schädlicher Pflanzen zu reduzieren, was die Notwendigkeit für chemische Düngemittel und Herbizide verringern kann.\n\n7. Überleben der Arten: Einige Pflanzenarten sind an Feuer angepasst und benötigen Brände für ihre Samen zu sprengen und ihr Wachstum zu fördern.\n\n8. Brandgefahren überwachen: Die Durchführung kontrollierter Brände kann dazu beitragen, Brandgefahren zu kontrollieren und zu reduzieren, indem die Überreste von brennbaren Materialien in Gebieten, die anfällig für schwerere, unkontrollierbare Brände sind, entfernt werden.\n\n9. Umweltreinigungen: Kontrollierte Brände können dazu beitragen, Umweltverschmutzung zu reduzieren, indem sie organische Abfälle und verschmutzte Vegetation, die Bakterien und Pestizide enthalten, in Kohlendioxid, Wasser und Asche umwandeln.\n\n10. Ökonomische Vorteile: Durch die Verringerung der Notwendigkeit für chemische Schädlingsbekämpfungsmittel, Düngemittel und andere Landbewirtschaftungsmittel können kontrollierte Brände den Landwirten und Gartenbauern Kosten sparen.\n\nEs ist jedoch wichtig zu beachten, dass kontrollierte Brände verantwortungsvoll durchgeführt werden müssen, da sie, wenn sie nicht richtig verwaltet werden, zu Bodenerosion, Verlust von Bodenfruchtbarkeit, Luftverschmutzung und Schäden für Tierleben führen können.

    "response": "Der Unterschied zwischen den legislativen Befugnissen des Senats und des Repräsentantenhauses im australischen Parlament liegt hauptsächlich in ihren spezifischen Rollen bei der Gesetzgebung und ihren Einschränkungen:\n\n1. Befugnisse bei der Gesetzgebung:\n   - Sowohl der Senat als auch das Repräsentantenhaus haben die gleiche Befugnis, Gesetze zu entwerfen und zu verabschieden. Ein Gesetz kann nur in Kraft treten, wenn es in beiden Häusern verabschiedet und von der Gouverneurin (der amtierenden Monarchin oder der vom Parlament ernannten Person) unterschrieben wird.\n   - Der Senat hat eine Einschränkung in Bezug auf Geldgesetze (Bücher, die Ausgaben- oder Steuerausschüttungsmaßnahmen enthalten). Der Senat kann diese Gesetze nur genehmigen oder ablehnen, aber nicht ändern. Das Repräsentantenhaus kann jedoch Geldgesetze ändern, und wenn der Senat Änderungen ablehnt, kann das Repräsentantenhaus diese Änderungen erneut dem Senat zur Genehmigung vorlegen. Wenn der Senat erneut ablehnt, kann das Repräsentantenhaus die Änderungen mit einer Zweidrittelmehrheit im Repräsentantenhaus ratifizieren und das Gesetz wird mit den Änderungen verabschiedet.\n   - In anderen Bereichen (außer Geldgesetzen) können sowohl der Senat als auch das Repräsentantenhaus Gesetze ändern. Wenn sich die beiden Häuser über eine Gesetzentwürfe unterscheiden, wird ein Kompromiss erreicht, oder ein Mediationstreik (außerhalb des Gesetzgebungsprozesses) kann eingreifen, um die Meinungsverschiedenheiten zu lösen.\n\n2. Repräsentation:\n   - Der Senat repräsentiert das gesamte australische Volk, wobei jeder Bundesstaat, einschließlich der Territorien, durch zwei Senatoren vertreten wird, und jede Fläche des Bundesstaates durch einen Senator.\n   - Das Repräsentantenhaus stellt die Bevölkerung dar, wobei die Sitze zwischen den Staaten und Territorien nach ihrer Bevölkerung verteilt sind. Die Anzahl der Sitze jedes Staates und Territoriums im Repräsentantenhaus wird jährlich anhand der Volkszählung bestimmt (der Zensus), um die Bevölkerungsverteilung zu reflektieren.\n\n3. Amtszeit:\n   - Senatoren werden für sechs Jahre gewählt, mit einer Hälfte der Sitze zum Wählen alle drei Jahre (quintennial election cycle), was eine kontinuierliche Erneuerung im Senat ermöglicht.\n   - Abgeordnete (Repräsentanten) werden im Verhältnis zu ihrer jeweiligen Wahlkreisbevölkerung für drei Jahre gewählt, mit einer Hälfte der Sitze zum Wählen alle drei Jahre.\n\n4. Befugnisse bei den Haushaltsgesetzen:\n   - Der Senat hat die einzigartige Befugnis, Haushaltsgesetze (Gesetze, die Ausgaben des Bundes betreffen) zu genehmigen. Dies bedeutet, dass der Senat entscheidend in der Genehmigung der finanziellen Mittel für die Regierung spielt.\n\n5. Suspendierende Macht:\n   - Der Senat hat die Suspendierende Macht, die es ihm ermöglicht, das Misstrauen gegen den Bundesminister zu äußern, in dem Fall dass das Repräsentantenhaus den Minister zum Rücktritt aufgebürdet hat. Um einen Minister zu entlassen, ist jedoch die Zustimmung des Senats erforderlich.\n\nZusammenfassend, obwohl der Senat und das Repräsentantenhaus über die grundlegende Fähigkeit zur Gesetzgebung gleichgestaltet sind, gibt es Einschränkungen, die dem Senat in Geldgesetzen und seiner Rolle bei der Genehmigung von Haushaltsgesetzen vorbehalten sind, sowie Unterschiede in der Repräsentation und der Amtszeit ihrer Mitglieder. Diese Unterschiede schaffen ein System gegenseitiger Kontrolle und Kompromisse, das darauf ausgelegt ist, ein ausgewogenes und breites Interesse der gesamten Nation in den Gesetzgebungsprozess einzubeziehen.",

Er ist bekannt für die Schaffung eines universellen Sonnenuhren, ein Konzept, das es einem Solarkalender ermöglichte, überall auf der Erde genau zu funktionieren. Theodosius' Entdeckung war bedeutend, weil sie die Notwendigkeit von lokalen Anpassungen in traditionellen Sonnenuhren beseitigte, die an spezifische Breitengrade angepasst werden mussten, um die Zeit genau zu verfolgen.\n\nTheodosius' universelle Solarkalender basierte auf der Idee, dass es eine bestimmte Konfiguration von Sonne, Mond und Planeten geben könnte, die unabhängig von der geographischen Lage gleich bleiben könnte. Er schlug vor, dass man diese Konfigurationen verfolgen und verwenden könnte, um die Zeit überall auf der Erde zu bestimmen. Sein Konzept wurde jedoch nie vollständig umgesetzt, und die praktische Anwendung von universellen Solarkalendern blieb bis zum 16. Jahrhundert, als Johannes Gutenberg die Druckerpresse erfand, eine Herausforderung, da präzise Zeitmessung für die Navigation und das wissenschaftliche Entdecken entscheidend wurde.\n\nTheodosius von Bithynien ist auch dafür bekannt, dass er das Konzept des Julianischen Kalenders entwickelte, einer Kalendersystem, das später vom römischen Kaiser Diokletian übernommen wurde und das heutige gregorianische Kalender ersetzt, der wir heute verwenden. Der Julianische Kalender führte eine 365-Tage-Schaltjahr ein, um die jahreszeitlichen Abweichungen des Sonnenjahres zu kompensieren, und war eine bedeutende Verbesserung gegenüber dem vorherigen äquinoktialen Kalender, der von Julius Caesar eingeführt wurde.",

Hier sind einige Beispiele:\n\n1. **Antike Griechenland und Rom**: Klepsydrenen wurden in der antiken griechischen und römischen Zeit weit verbreitet genutzt. Sie wurden in privaten Häusern, öffentlichen Thermen und sogar in öffentlichen Plätzen verwendet, um die Zeit zu messen. Der berühmteste Bericht über eine Klepsydre stammt von Platon, der besagt, dass in der Akademie von Athen eine Klepsydre zur Begrenzung der Zeit für Diskussionen verwendet wurde.\n\n2. **Islamisches Goldene Zeitalter**: Im Mittelalter, insbesondere während des islamischen Goldenen Zeitalters, wurden Klepsydren in der arabischen Welt weiterentwickelt. Sie wurden nicht nur zur Zeitmessung verwendet, sondern auch in komplexen mechanischen Uhren zur Berechnung von Zeit und Datum, einschließlich der Berechnung des Sonnenstandes. Diese Entwicklungen führten zum Bau großer Wasseruhren in Moscheen und Klöstern.\n\n3. **Indische Architektur**: Wasseruhren wurden auch in der indischen Architektur verwendet, insbesondere in Tempeln und Palästen. Zum Beispiel war der Tempel Brihadeeswarar in Thanjavur in Indien mit einer Wasseruhr ausgestattet, die den Fluss des Wassers verwendete, um Zeit und Datum anzuzeigen.\n\n4. **Europa im Mittelalter**: In Europa wurden Klepsydren im Mittelalter in Klöstern, Kirchen und öffentlichen Gebäuden verwendet. Sie wurden als praktische Geräte zur Zeitmessung verwendet, insbesondere in Zeiten, in denen die Zeitgenauigkeit nicht so hoch war wie heute.\n\n5. **Moderne Nutzung**: Obwohl moderne Technologie die Notwendigkeit von Wasseruhren für die Zeitmessung überwunden hat, werden sie noch heute verwendet, um historische Präzision zu bewahren und als dekorative Elemente in der Architektur und im Design.\n\nWasseruhren wurden an verschiedenen Orten verwendet, wo Wasser verfügbar war, wie Brunnen, Reservoirs und sogar Flüsse. Ihre Anwendung war jedoch aufgrund ihrer Abhängigkeit von Wasser und Wetterbedingungen sowie der Notwendigkeit regelmäßiger Wartung und Kalibrierung nicht weit verbreitet. Mit dem Aufkommen der mechanischen und später der elektronischen Uhren wurden Wasseruhren weniger praktisch, werden aber immer noch geschätzt als historische Artefakte und kunstvolle Strukturen.",

    "response": "Wenn der Druck auf ein Objekt zunimmt, nimmt die resultierende Folge je nach den beteiligten Umständen variieren können:\n\n1. **Materialausdehnung**: Bei vielen Materialien führt eine Erhöhung des Drucks zu einer Verringerung ihres Volumens, auch bekannt als Kompression. Dies liegt daran, dass die Teilchen im Material näher zusammenrücken, was zu einer Abnahme des Volumens führt.\n\n2. **Änderung der physikalischen Eigenschaften**: Erhöhter Druck kann die Eigenschaften eines Materials ändern. Zum Beispiel kann er die Schmelztemperatur senken, wodurch das Material bei einem niedrigeren Temperaturanstieg schmilzt.\n\n3. **Übergangspunkte**: In einigen Materialien, wie bei Edelgasen, kann die Erhöhung des Drucks den Übergang von einem Gaszustand in einen Flüssigkeits- oder sogar festen Zustand bei höheren Drücken bewirken.\n\n4. **Flüssigkeitsdruck**: In einem Flüssigkeitsbehälter führt eine Erhöhung des Drucks zu einer Erhöhung des Flüssigkeitsdrucks, wie von Pascal's Gesetz beschrieben. Dies bedeutet, dass der Druck, den das Flüsschen auf die Wände des Behälters ausübt, zunimmt, wenn der auf den Behälter ausgeübte Druck steigt.\n\n5. **Zerspanung und Bruch**: Bei Materialien wie Metallen kann eine zu hohe Druckerhöhung zu Zerspanung oder Bruch führen, da die Festigkeit des Materials die Druckbelastung übersteigt.\n\n6. **Änderung der chemischen Reaktionen**: Druck kann auch die Kinetik und die Ausgänge chemischer Reaktionen beeinflussen. Hoher Druck kann die Reaktivität bestimmter Substanzen steigern und zu unerwarteten Produkten oder Reaktionsraten führen.\n\n7. **Quantenlevel-Effekte**: Bei extrem hohem Druck, wie es in der Physik der Materie bei tiefen Atomen oder in der Physik der kondensierten Materie bei Hochdruckexperimente beobachtet wird, können die physikalischen Eigenschaften von Materie drastisch ändern, was zu neuen Zuständen der Materie führen kann.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass diese Effekte je nach den spezifischen Bedingungen, wie Material, Art und Grad der Druckerhöhung und den beteiligten Systemen, unterschiedlich ausgeprägt sein können.",

Keine beweglichen Teile: Weihrauchuhren haben keine beweglichen Teile, die brechen oder abrutschen könnten, was ein Risiko bei mechanischen Uhren darstellt, die mit Klingen oder Zahnrädern ausgestattet sind.\n\n2. Harte Uhrenwerkskonstruktion: Die Uhrwerkstücke in Weihrauchuhren sind fest in der Uhrgehäuse verankert, was das Risiko einer Verletzung verringert, wenn die Uhr an einem bestimmten Ort platziert wird.\n\n3. Keine Reibung: Da Weihrauchuhren keine beweglichen Teile haben, gibt es keine Reibung, die das Material im Inneren der Uhr beschädigen könnte, wie es bei mechanischen Uhren der Fall sein könnte.\n\n4. Keine giftigen Substanzen: Im Gegensatz zu einigen modernen Uhren, die Silikonkügeln oder anderen chemischen Materialien verwenden, waren die in Weihrauchuhren verwendeten Materialien nicht giftig. Der Weihrauch, der für die Visierung verwendet wurde, ist auch nicht bekannt dafür, gesundheitsschädlich zu sein, wenn er in einer Uhr in einem geschlossenen Raum verwendet wird.\n\n5. Konservierung der Zeit: Weihrauchuhren wurden oft in Innenräumen verwendet, um wichtige Ereignisse und Daten aufzuzeichnen, was darauf hindeutet, dass ihre Verwendung in diesen Umgebungen als sicher angesehen wurde.\n\nEs ist jedoch wichtig zu beachten, dass Weihrauchuhren, obwohl sie als sicherer galten, keine präzisen Zeitmesser waren. Sie konnten sich im Laufe des Tages mit einer Variabilität von ein paar Minuten bis zu einer Stunde verschieben. Für die genaue Zeitmessung wurden mechanische Uhren oder heutige Quartz-Uhren verwendet.

      "\n\nDifferent powdered incense clocks used different formulations of incense, depending on how the clock was laid out. \nThe length of the trail of incense, directly related to the size of the seal, was the primary factor in determining how long the clock would last; all burned for long periods of time, ranging between 12 hours and a month.While early incense seals were made of wood or stone, the Chinese gradually introduced disks made of metal, most likely beginning during the Song dynasty. \nThis allowed craftsmen to more easily create both large and small seals, as well as design and decorate them more aesthetically. \nAnother advantage was the ability to vary the paths of the grooves, to allow for the changing length of the days in the year. \nAs smaller seals became more readily available, the clocks grew in popularity among the Chinese, and were often given as gifts. \nIncense seal clocks are often sought by modern-day clock collectors; however, few remain that have not already been purchased or been placed on display at museums or temples. \nOther ancient timekeeping devices include the candle clock, used in ancient China, ancient Japan, England and Mesopotamia; the timestick, widely used in India and Tibet, as well as some parts of Europe; and the hourglass, which functioned similarly to a water clock.  \nThe sundial, another early clock, relies on shadows to provide a good estimate of the hour on a sunny day.

In the fall of 1989, as part of an agreement between the Communists and the opposition to establish multiparty democracy, the 1949 Constitution was almost completely rewritten to remove its Communist character. The Presidential Council, the country's Communist-era collective presidency, was dissolved. Under the Constitution, Szűrös became provisional president until the election. Soon after taking office on 23 October he made the official proclamation that Hungary had removed the \"People's Republic\" from its constitutional name and was now the \"Republic of Hungary.\"",

      "\n\nVega: In astronomy, those elements with higher atomic numbers than helium are termed \"metals\". \nThe metallicity of Vega's photosphere is only about 32% of the abundance of heavy elements in the Sun's atmosphere. \n(Compare this, for example, to a threefold metallicity abundance in the similar star Sirius as compared to the Sun.) \nFor comparison, the Sun has an abundance of elements heavier than helium of about ZSol = 0.0172 ± 0.002. \nThus, in terms of abundances, only about 0.54% of Vega consists of elements heavier than helium. \nThe unusually low metallicity of Vega makes it a weak Lambda Boötis star. \nHowever, the reason for the existence of such chemically peculiar, spectral class A0-F0 stars remains unclear. \nOne possibility is that the chemical peculiarity may be the result of diffusion or mass loss, although stellar models show that this would normally only occur near the end of a star's hydrogen-burning lifespan. \nAnother possibility is that the star formed from an interstellar medium of gas and dust that was unusually metal-poor.The observed helium to hydrogen ratio in Vega is 0.030 ± 0.005, which is about 40% lower than the Sun. \nThis may be caused by the disappearance of a helium convection zone near the surface. \nEnergy transfer is instead performed by the radiative process, which may be causing an abundance anomaly through diffusion. ",
      "\n\nThis is in contrast to the Sun, which has a radiation zone centered on the core with an overlying convection zone.The energy flux from Vega has been precisely measured against standard light sources. \nAt 5480 Å, the flux is 3,650 Jy with an error margin of 2%. \nThe visual spectrum of Vega is dominated by absorption lines of hydrogen; specifically by the hydrogen Balmer series with the electron at the n=2 principal quantum number. \nThe lines of other elements are relatively weak, with the strongest being ionized magnesium, iron, and chromium. \nThe X-ray emission from Vega is very low, demonstrating that the corona for this star must be very weak or non-existent. \nHowever, as the pole of Vega is facing Earth and a polar coronal hole may be present, confirmation of a corona as the likely source of the X-rays detected from Vega (or the region very close to Vega) may be difficult as most of any coronal X-rays would not be emitted along the line of sight.Using spectropolarimetry, a magnetic field has been detected on the surface of Vega by a team of astronomers at the Observatoire du Pic du Midi. \nThis is the first such detection of a magnetic field on a spectral class A star that is not an Ap chemically peculiar star. \nThe average line of sight component of this field has a strength of −0.6 ± 0.3 G. \nThis is comparable to the mean magnetic field on the Sun.

      "\n\nAtom: All the bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up a tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. \nThe radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07 3√A fm, where A is the total number of nucleons. \nThis is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105 fm. \nThe nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. \nAt distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.Atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, called the atomic number. \nWithin a single element, the number of neutrons may vary, determining the isotope of that element. \nThe total number of protons and neutrons determine the nuclide. \nThe number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes undergoing radioactive decay.The proton, the electron, and the neutron are classified as fermions. \nFermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle which prohibits identical fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum state at the same time.

      "\n\nAcceptable daily intake: An ADI value is based on current research, with long-term studies on animals and observations of humans. \nFirst, a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL), the amount of a substance that shows no toxic effects, is determined. \nUsually the studies are performed with several doses including high doses. \nIn the case of several studies on different effects, the lowest NOAEL is usually taken.  \nThen, the NOAEL (or another point of departure such as a benchmark dose level (BMDL)) is divided by a safety factor, conventionally 100, to account for the differences between test animals and humans (factor of 10) and possible differences in sensitivity between humans (another factor of 10). safety factors with values other than 100 may be used if information on uncertainty about the value of the point of departure (NOAEL or BMDL) justify it. \nFor instance, if the ADI is based on data from humans the safety factor is usually 10 instead of 100. \nThe ADI is usually given in mg per kg body weight.The ADI is considered a safe intake level for a healthy adult of normal weight who consumes an average daily amount of the substance in question. \nIncreased safety factors for infants have been discussed, but are not needed, because elimination of chemicals is in fact often more rapid in children and as children generally suffer higher illness rates than adults, adverse effects caused by food additives can easily be disguised as any number of things children usually suffer with.

      "\n\nThroughout Pitt's ministry, George supported many of Pitt's political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt's supporters in the House of Lords. \nDuring and after Pitt's ministry, George III was extremely popular in Britain. \nThe British people admired him for his piety, and for remaining faithful to his wife. \nHe was fond of his children, and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy in 1782 and 1783 respectively. \nNevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. \nThey were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning, and to lead lives of religious observance and virtue. \nWhen his children strayed from George's own principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed and disappointed.By this time George's health was deteriorating. \nHe had a mental illness, characterised by acute mania, which was possibly a symptom of the genetic disease porphyria, although this has been questioned. \nA study of samples of the King's hair published in 2005 revealed high levels of arsenic, a possible trigger for the disease. \nThe source of the arsenic is not known, but it could have been a component of medicines or cosmetics. \nThe King may have had a brief episode of disease in 1765, but a longer episode began in the summer of 1788. \nAt the end of the parliamentary session, he went to Cheltenham Spa to recuperate.

Die Position Berlins variierte je nach Zeitperiode und politischen Umständen.\n\nWährend des Russisch-Japanischen Krieges (1904-1905) versuchte Berlin, als neutrale Macht zu agieren und eine friedliche Lösung des Konflikts zu fördern. Deutschland strebte dabei an, seine Beziehungen zu Russland und Großbritannien zu erhalten, indem es versuchte, einen diplomatischen Ausweg zu finden, der den Konflikt zwischen den beiden Mächten lösen würde. Berlin unterstützte die Autonomie Koreas, was teilweise durch seine eigenen strategischen Interessen an der Region motiviert war. Die deutsche Position war geprägt von einer gewissen Zurückhaltung und dem Wunsch, die Situation ohne direkte Einmischung zu bewerten und möglicherweise als Vermittler zwischen Japan und Russland zu fungieren.\n\nWährend des Ersten Weltkriegs (1914-1918) änderte sich die Position Berlins dramatisch. Deutschland erklärte sich im August 1914 an der Seite von Österreich-Ungarn im Krieg gegen Russland und Frankreich. Die anglo-deutsche Entente, bestehend aus Großbritannien und Russland, wurde zum Feind Berlins. Berlin versuchte, seine Position zu stärken, indem es versuchte, Russland durch diplomatische Verhandlungen, wie den Vertrags von Brest-Litowsk (1918), zu schwächen und so den Krieg zu seinen Gunsten zu gestalten. Die deutsche Regierung unter Kaiser Wilhelm II und später unter der Reichsregierung unter der Führung von Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg versuchte, einen Waffenstillstand zu erreichen, um die Ressourcen für den Krieg zu erhalten.\n\nJedoch führten die militärischen Erfolge der Entente und die allmähliche Schwächung der deutschen Position auf dem Kriegsschauplatz dazu, dass Berlin zunehmend isoliert wurde. Die Belagerung Berlins durch die Alliierten (vorwiegend Russland) im November 1918 und die daraus resultierende Revolution im Dezember 1918 führten zur Abdankung des Kaisers und dem Ende des Deutschen Kaiserreichs.\n\nInsgesamt kann man sagen, dass Berlin während dieser Perioden seine Position zwischen Neutralität und aktiver Beteiligung an den Kriegen, die Russland und den Alliierten gegenüber einnahm, variierte und dabei immer sein Interesse an der Bewahrung und Erweiterung der deutschen Macht verfolgte.",

Wie viele andere frühchristliche Päpste, ist auch über Papst Caius nicht viel über sein Leben bekannt, außer aus dem Liber Pontificalis, einem späten mittelalterlichen Geschichtswerk, das Legenden über die Päpste enthält.\n\nDie Rolle des Papstes in der katholischen Kirche, wie sie auch heute noch ist, umfasste die Leitung der Kirche, die Verkündung von Bullen (päpstlichen Dekreten) und die Durchführung der Sakramente, insbesondere der Weihen. Papst Caius war jedoch auch in rechtliche und administrative Angelegenheiten der Kirche involviert, insbesondere in Rom.\n\nEines der bekanntesten Ereignisse während seiner Amtszeit war die Unterteilung der Stadt Rom unter den deaconischen Bezirken, was die Organisation der kirchlichen Verwaltung und den Beginn der Praxis der diözesanen Struktur in der Kirche markierte. Diese Maßnahme war bedeutend, da sie dazu beitrug, die Kirche zu einem strukturierten und effektiveren Instrument für das geistliche Leben der Gläubigen in der Stadt zu machen.\n\nDie anti-christlichen Maßnahmen, die während seines Pontifikats zunahmen, sind ebenfalls Teil seiner Amtszeit. Die Christen unter der Herrschaft der Römer, einschließlich derer, die in der Kirche dienten, standen oft vor Verfolgungen, insbesondere während der Regierungszeit von Diokletian, der eine intensive Periode der Verfolgung der Christen initiierte. Es wird angenommen, dass Papst Caius selbst während dieser Zeit der Verfolgung starb, aber dies ist nicht überliefert.\n\nLaut christlicher Tradition war Papst Caius ein frommer Mann, der die Gläubigen getauft hatte, die von den Aposteln Tiburtius und Castulus um das Jahr 280 n. Chr. getauft worden waren. Laut dieser Tradition zog er sich in die Katakomben von Rom zurück, als er von Verfolgungen bedroht war, und starb als Märtyrer.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass viele Berichte über Papst Caius, einschließlich der Legende seiner Martyrium, Legenden sind und nicht durch historische Beweise gestützt werden.

      "\n\nPope Caius: As pope, Caius decreed that before someone could assume the position of bishop, he must first be porter, lector, exorcist, acolyte, subdeacon, deacon, and priest. He also divided the districts of Rome among the deacons. During his pontificate, anti-Christian measures increased, although new churches were built and cemeteries were expanded. St Caius may not have been martyred: Diocletian’s persecution of Christians began in 303 AD, after Caius’ alleged death, and Diocletian was not immediately hostile to Christianity upon becoming emperor. Pope Caius (died 22 April 296), also called Gaius, was the Bishop of Rome from 17 December 283 to his death in 296. Christian tradition makes him a native of the Dalmatian city of Salona, today Solin near Split, the son of a man also named Caius, and a member of a noble family related to the Emperor Diocletian.Little information on Caius is available except that given by the Liber Pontificalis, which relies on a legendary account of the martyrdom of St. Susanna for its information.

Kodifizierung der Gesetze: Er vereinte verschiedene lokale Gesetze in ein einheitliches, umfassendes Gesetzessystem, das als das \"Qin-Buch\" bekannt ist.\n\n6. Zentralisierung des Staates: Er reformierte den Verwaltungssystem und zentralisierte die Macht, wodurch er den Einfluss lokaler Herrscher und mächtiger Aristokraten minderte.\n\n7. Wissenschaft und Kultur: Er förderte den wissenschaftlichen Fortschritt, darunter Astronomie, Mathematik und Ingenieurwesen, und ermutigte die Künste, einschließlich Poesie, Malerei und Architektur.\n\n8.

      "\n\nGeorge VI: 22 January 1901 – 9 November 1901: His Royal Highness Prince Albert of Cornwall and York George was born at York Cottage, on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria. \nHis father was Prince George, Duke of York (later King George V), the second and eldest-surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra). \nHis mother was the Duchess of York (later Queen Mary), the eldest child and only daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Teck.His birthday, 14 December 1895, was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather, Albert, Prince Consort. \nUncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been \"rather distressed\". \nTwo days later, he wrote again: \"I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her\". \nQueen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: \"I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good\". \nConsequently, he was baptised \"Albert Frederick Arthur George\" at St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham, three months later. ",
      "\n\nWith the clear support of Parliament, Lord North introduced measures, which were called the Intolerable Acts by the colonists: the Port of Boston was shut down and the charter of Massachusetts was altered so that the upper house of the legislature was appointed by the Crown instead of elected by the lower house. \nUp to this point, in the words of Professor Peter Thomas, George's \"hopes were centred on a political solution, and he always bowed to his cabinet's opinions even when sceptical of their success. \nThe detailed evidence of the years from 1763 to 1775 tends to exonerate George III from any real responsibility for the American Revolution.\" \nThough the Americans characterised George as a tyrant, in these years he acted as a constitutional monarch supporting the initiatives of his ministers. \nGeorge, in his accession speech to Parliament, proclaimed: \"Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of Britain.\" \nHe inserted this phrase into the speech, written by Lord Hardwicke, to demonstrate his desire to distance himself from his German forebears, who were perceived as caring more for Hanover than for Britain.Although his accession was at first welcomed by politicians of all parties, the first years of his reign were marked by political instability, largely generated as a result of disagreements over the Seven Years' War. \nGeorge was also perceived as favouring Tory ministers, which led to his denunciation by the Whigs as an autocrat. ",
      "\n\nGeorge insisted on a new law that essentially forbade members of the Royal Family from legally marrying without the consent of the Sovereign. \nThe subsequent bill was unpopular in Parliament, including among George's own ministers, but passed as the Royal Marriages Act 1772. \nShortly afterward, another of George's brothers, Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, revealed he had been secretly married to Maria, Countess Waldegrave, the illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole. \nThe news confirmed George's opinion that he had been right to introduce the law: Maria was related to his political opponents. \nNeither lady was ever received at court.Lord North's government was chiefly concerned with discontent in America. \nTo assuage American opinion most of the custom duties were withdrawn, except for the tea duty, which in George's words was \"one tax to keep up the right [to levy taxes]\". \nIn 1773, the tea ships moored in Boston Harbor were boarded by colonists and the tea thrown overboard, an event that became known as the Boston Tea Party. \nIn Britain, opinion hardened against the colonists, with Chatham now agreeing with North that the destruction of the tea was \"certainly criminal\".

      "\n\nHistory of chemistry: Around 420 BC, Empedocles stated that all matter is made up of four elemental substances: earth, fire, air and water. The early theory of atomism can be traced back to ancient Greece and ancient India. Greek atomism dates back to the Greek philosopher Democritus, who declared that matter is composed of indivisible and indestructible particles called \"atomos\" around 380 BC. Leucippus also declared that atoms were the most indivisible part of matter. This coincided with a similar declaration by Indian philosopher Kanada in his Vaisheshika sutras around the same time period. In much the same fashion he discussed the existence of gases. What Kanada declared by sutra, Democritus declared by philosophical musing. Both suffered from a lack of empirical data. Without scientific proof, the existence of atoms was easy to deny. Aristotle opposed the existence of atoms in 330 BC. Earlier, in 380 BC, a Greek text attributed to Polybus argued that the human body is composed of four humours. Around 300 BC, Epicurus postulated a universe of indestructible atoms in which man himself is responsible for achieving a balanced life.",
      "\n\nTernary computer: One early calculating machine, built by Thomas Fowler entirely from wood in 1840, operated in balanced ternary. \nThe first modern, electronic ternary computer Setun was built in 1958 in the Soviet Union at the Moscow State University by Nikolay Brusentsov, and it had notable advantages over the binary computers which eventually replaced it, such as lower electricity consumption and lower production cost. \nIn 1970 Brusentsov built an enhanced version of the computer, which he called Setun-70.  \nIn the USA, the ternary computing emulator Ternac working on a binary machine was developed in 1973.\nThe ternary computer QTC-1 was developed in Canada. \nWith the advent of mass-produced binary components for computers, ternary computers have diminished in significance. \nHowever, Donald Knuth argues that they will be brought back into development in the future to take advantage of ternary logic's elegance and efficiency. \nOne possible way this could happen is by combining an optical computer with the ternary logic system. \nA ternary computer using fiber optics could use dark as 0 and two orthogonal polarizations of light as 1 and −1. \nIBM also reports infrequently on ternary computing topics (in its papers), but it is not actively engaged in it.The Josephson junction has been proposed as a balanced ternary memory cell, using circulating superconducting currents, either clockwise, counterclockwise, or off.

      "\n\nHurricane John (1994): Clearing Johnston Atoll, John turned to the northwest and began strengthening again as shear decreased. \nOn August 27 local time, John reached a secondary peak strength of 135 miles per hour (210 km/h), and shortly thereafter it crossed the International Date Line at approximately 22° N and came under the surveillance of the Guam branch of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). \nBy crossing into the western Pacific, John also became a typhoon and was referred to as Typhoon John during its time in the western Pacific. \nImmediately after crossing the Date Line, John again weakened and its forward motion stalled. \nBy September 1, John had weakened to a tropical storm and was nearly motionless just west of the Date Line. \nThere, John lingered for six days while performing a multi-day counterclockwise loop. \nOn September 7, a trough moved into the area and quickly moved John to the northeast. \nJohn crossed the Date Line again on September 8 and reentered the central Pacific.After reentering the central Pacific, John briefly reached a tertiary peak strength of 90 miles per hour (145 km/h), a strong Category 1 hurricane, well to the north of Midway Island. \nHowever, the trough was rapidly pulling apart John's structure, and the cold waters of the northern central Pacific were not conducive to a tropical cyclone. ",
      "\n\nAround 1100 PDT on August 20, John crossed into the central Pacific, the first of three basin crosses John would make.After entering the central Pacific, John left the area monitored by the NHC and was instead monitored by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). \nAs the storm moved slowly westward, Hurricane John continued to strengthen considerably in an increasingly favorable environment well south of the Hawaiian Islands; on August 22, John was designated a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale (the highest classification for hurricanes) and later that day (by Hawaii Standard Time) reached its peak intensity, with 1-minute sustained winds of 175 miles per hour (280 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 929 millibars (27.4 inHg). \nAlso, on August 22 (by Hawaii Standard Time), John made its closest approach to the Hawaiian Islands, 345 miles (500 km) to the south. \nJohn had threatened to turn north and affect the islands days before, but the ridge of high pressure that typically shields the islands from hurricanes kept John on its southerly path. \nNonetheless, heavy rains and wind from the outer bands of John affected the islands.With the Hawaiian Islands behind it, John began a slow turn to the north, taking near-direct aim at Johnston Atoll, a small group of islands populated only by a United States military base.

    "reference": "chronic inflation",
    "response": "Münzen werden abgewertet, weil sie im Laufe der Zeit abgenutzt werden. Dieser Prozess wird als Abwertung bezeichnet. Es gibt verschiedene Gründe, warum Münzen abgewertet werden:\n\n1. **Erschöpfung**: Mit der Zeit werden Münzen häufig benutzt, und die Kanten und Oberflächen können abgenutzt werden. Dies kann zu einem Verlust von Material und einer abnehmenden Prägung auf der Münze führen.\n\n2. **Korrosion**: Münzen bestehen oft aus Metall, das mit der Zeit durch chemische Reaktionen, wie die Oxidation, abgenutzt werden kann, was zu einer Verfärbung und Lockerung des Materials führt.\n\n3. **Sicherheitsmaßnahmen**: Regierungen ändern manchmal die Sicherheitsmerkmale von Münzen, um Fälschungen zu verhindern. Wenn eine neue Version einer Münze eingeführt wird, könnte die alte Version als weniger wertvoll angesehen werden, da sie nicht mehr die neuesten Sicherheitsmerkmale hat.\n\n4. **Sammeln**: In einigen Fällen werden Münzen abgewertet, weil sie Teil eines Sammlerstücks sind, wie zum Beispiel alte oder seltene Münzen. Wenn sie für Sammler zu selten werden, könnten sie weniger wert sein, wenn sie nicht in Sammlermünzform sind.\n\n5. **Rohheit**: Wenn ein Metallmünze zu roh ist, bedeutet das, dass es in der Herstellung nicht die richtige Reinheit hatte. Dies kann den Wert der Münze für den Handel verringern.\n\n6. **Fälschungsschutz**: Münzen werden entworfen, um schwer zu fälschen, und wenn ein Fälscher in der Lage ist, Kopien zu erstellen, die für den Handel indistinguishierbar sind, kann dies die Wertigkeit der Originalmünzen verringern.\n\nEs ist wichtig zu beachten, dass die Abwertung eine natürliche Folge des physischen Verhaltens der Münzen im Laufe der Zeit ist und keine Absicht der Regierung ist, den Wert der Münze zu reduzieren.

      "\n\nIsaac Newton: From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During this period he investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum produced by a prism could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.He showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour. From 1978 until 1988, an image of Newton designed by Harry Ecclestone appeared on Series D £1 banknotes issued by the Bank of England (the last £1 notes to be issued by the Bank of England). Newton was shown on the reverse of the notes holding a book and accompanied by a telescope, a prism and a map of the Solar System."

The Milky Way Galaxy, where our own Solar System is located, is classified as a barred spiral galaxy.Edwin Hubble classified spiral galaxies of this type as \"SB\" (spiral, barred) in his Hubble sequence and arranged them into sub-categories based on how open the arms of the spiral are. SBa types feature tightly bound arms, while SBc types are at the other extreme and have loosely bound arms. SBb-type galaxies lie in between the two. SB0 is a barred lenticular galaxy. A new type, SBm, was subsequently created to describe somewhat irregular barred spirals, such as the Magellanic Clouds, which were once classified as irregular galaxies, but have since been found to contain barred spiral structures.

      "\n\nGeorge III of the United Kingdom: A brief lull in hostilities allowed Pitt to concentrate effort on Ireland, where there had been an uprising and attempted French landing in 1798. \nIn 1800, the British and Irish Parliaments passed an Act of Union that took effect on 1 January 1801 and united Great Britain and Ireland into a single state, known as the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\". \nGeorge used the opportunity to abandon the title \"king of France\", which English and British Sovereigns had maintained since the reign of Edward III. \nIt was suggested that George adopt the title \"Emperor of the British Isles\", but he refused. \nAs part of his Irish policy, Pitt planned to remove certain legal disabilities that applied to Roman Catholics. \nGeorge III claimed that to emancipate Catholics would be to violate his coronation oath, in which Sovereigns promise to maintain Protestantism. \nFaced with opposition to his religious reform policies from both the King and the British public, Pitt threatened to resign. \nAt about the same time, the King had a relapse of his previous illness, which he blamed on worry over the Catholic question. \nOn 14 March 1801, Pitt was formally replaced by the Speaker of the House of Commons, Henry Addington. \nAddington opposed emancipation, instituted annual accounts, abolished income tax and began a programme of disarmament. \nIn October 1801, he made peace with the French, and in 1802 signed the Treaty of Amiens.George did not consider the peace with France as real; in his view it was an \"experiment\".

On the other hand, for instance, a triple consisting of the length, width, and height of a rectangular box could make up the three components of an abstract vector, but this vector would not be contravariant, since rotating the box does not change the box's length, width, and height.

    "reference": "The strike",
    "response": "Ja, Sinn Féin's Rolle im Kontext der irischen Politik und seiner Transformation in eine populäre politische Partei sind miteinander verbunden. Der Sinn Féin, was Irisch für \"Wir selbst\" bedeutet, wurde 1905 von Arthur Griffith und anderen gegründet und hatte anfänglich sowohl republikanische als auch separatistische Ziele für Irland. Im Laufe der Zeit hat Sinn Féin jedoch seine Politik angepasst und ist zu einer breiteren, inklusiven politischen Partei geworden.\n\nEin Schlüsselmoment in Sinn Féins Wandlung zu einer populären politischen Kraft war ihre Beteiligung an den Nordirlandgesprächen in den 1970er und 1980er Jahren. Im Jahr 1981 fand die hungerstreikende Protestbewegung (The Hunger Struggle) statt, die von republikanischen Gefangenen im Nordirland-Gefängnis geführt wurde. Sinn Féin unterstützte diese Proteste und wurde als Teil der nationalistischen, republikanischen Bewegung in Nordirland bekannt.\n\nDer Sinn Féin unter der Führung von Gerry Adams und anderen nahm 1986 eine Politik der \"drei Ns\" an – Nichtverhandlung, Nichtviolence und Nichtverzichtung – was bedeutete, dass sie keine Verhandlungen mit dem britischen Regierung, keine Gewalt und keine Anerkennung des britischen Rechts auf Nordirland akzeptieren würde. Diese Politik half dem Sinn Féin, einige Sympathisanten zu gewinnen, die Sinn Féins Positionen als eine, die sich für die irische Einheit und Souveränität ohne Kompromisse positionierte.\n\nDie Sinn Féin trat 1989 in die Nordirland-Politik ein, nachdem sie eine Einigung über die drei Ns getroffen hatte. Dies führte zur Teilnahme an den Nordirland-Gesprächen und zum Erreichen des Good Friday-Vertrages im Jahr 1998. Die Beteiligung des Sinn Féin an diesen Friedensgesprächen und seine Rolle bei den Fortschritten in Nordirland trugen zu einer Erholung des Vertrauens des irischen Volkes bei, was Sinn Féins Popularität erhöhte.\n\nIm Laufe der Jahre hat Sinn Féin seine Unterstützung für den Irischen Freistaat (Republik Irland) als die zukünftige Nation erweitert, was es einem breiteren Spektrum von Wählern in Nordirland zugänglich gemacht hat. Die Partei gewann zunehmend Sitze im Nordirischen Parlament und wurde ein wichtiger Akteur in der nordirischen Politik.\n\nSinn Féins Wandel in eine populäre politische Partei ist mit der sich ändernden politischen Landschaft in Nordirland und dem Erfolg des Verhandlungsprozesses in Bezug auf den Konflikt in Nordirland verbunden. Der Sinn Féin konnte eine Position einnehmen, die sowohl die nationalistischen Züge als auch die pragmatische Notwendigkeit des politischen Dialogs in Nordirland umfasste, was zu einer breiteren Wählerbasis führte.",

    "response": "Die Folterung von Tlacotzin und Cuauhtémoc war ein Teil der Versuche von Hernán Cortés und seiner Expedition, die mesoamerikanischen Reiche im 16. Jahrhundert zu erobern. Cortés, ein spanischer Konquistador, landete 1519 in der Region, die heute als Mexiko bekannt ist, und begann eine Reihe von Kämpfen sowohl mit den einheimischen Stämmen als auch untereinander, um seine Macht auszubauen.\n\nTlacotzin war ein Azteken-Herrscher, der Cortés und seinen Truppen im Jahr 1520 einen Pakt anbot, um sich ihm anzuschließen und gegen die anderen Azteken-Stämme zu rebellieren. Dieser Pakt, bekannt als der Pakt von Cuitláhuac, sollte Cortés helfen, seine Macht zu festigen und den Aufstand zu unterstützen. Als Tlacotzin jedoch versuchte, das Versprechen zu halten, wurde er von den eigenen Azteken verraten und von Cortés und seinen Truppen gefangen genommen. Cortés nutzte Tlacotzins Gefangenschaft, um die Unterstützung anderer Azteken-Stämme zu gewinnen, was zu einer entscheidenden Niederlage der Azteken in der Schlacht von Tenochtitlán im Jahr 1521 führte, die zum Fall des Aztekenreichs und zur Eroberung Mexikos führte.\n\nCuauhtémoc war der letzte aztekische Anführer, der die Stadt Tenochtitlán gegen die spanischen Eroberer Widerstand leistete. Nach der Eroberung wurde Cuauhtémoc gefangen genommen und von Cortés gefoltert, um die Standorte des Reichtums der Azteken zu erfahren, einschließlich der Aufenthaltsorte der imperialen Familienerbstücke und des Goldes. Die Folterung war Teil der brutalen Methoden, die Cortés und andere Konquistadoren verwendeten, um die einheimischen Völker zu kontrollieren und zu unterwerfen, oft mit dem Ziel, Informationen zu erlangen, die ihnen in ihren Expansionsbestrebungen hilfreich waren.\n\nDie Folterung von Tlacotzin und Cuauhtemoc war ein Resultat des Krieges und der Verhandlungen in einer Zeit großer Konflikte und kulturellen Kollisionen, als die spanische Kolonialmacht versuchte, die Amerikas zu erobern und ihre eigenen Werte, Strukturen und Besitztümer zu etablieren. Dies war eine tragische Periode in der Geschichte, die die einheimischen Bevölkerungen erheblich beeinflusste und oft zu Verlusten von Leben, kulturellen Unterdrückung und Ausrottung führte.",

Es sollte immer unter trockenen Bedingungen gehandhabt werden, idealerweise in einem Vakuum oder in einer trockenen Inertgasatmosphäre (wie Argon oder Helium).\n2. Inertgas: Die Handhabung und Lagerung von Methyllithium sollten in einem Inertgasumwandler durchgeführt werden, um die Reaktion mit atmosphärischem Sauerstoff oder anderen Feuchtigkeitseinträgen zu verhindern.\n3. Temperatur: Methyllithium sollte an einem kühlen Ort aufbewahrt werden. Hohe Temperaturen können die Reaktivität erhöhen und zur Bildung gefährlicher Dampf-Luft-Gemische führen. Es wird empfohlen, es bei Raumtemperatur aufzubewahren.\n4. Container: Methyllithium wird in Inertgasgemischen, wie Diethylether oder Tetrahydrofuran (THF), gelagert. Die Behälter sollten aus korrosiven Materialien bestehen und gut versiegelt sein, um das Eindringen von Luft und Wasser zu verhindern.\n5. Dosierung: Nur die erforderliche Menge Methyllithium sollte bei jeder Operation aufbewahrt werden, um das Risiko von Überdosierung und unkontrollierten Reaktionen zu minimieren.\n\nDurch Befolgen dieser Bedingungen kann die Sicherheit beim Umgang mit Methyllithium erhöht und die Wahrscheinlichkeit von unerwünschten Reaktionen oder Bränden reduziert werden.

Proper positioning, such as sitting up or using pillows, can also help maintain comfort and ease discomfort. If symptoms persist or worsen, it's important to seek medical attention. Remember, these tips are general in nature, and individuals with specific health conditions or concerns should consult their healthcare provider for personalized advice. 3. Stay Hydrated: Drinking enough fluids helps thin mucus, making it easier to cough up. Water, clear broths, and herbal teas are good choices. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can lead to dehydration. 4. Use Steam Inhalation: Boil water and inhale the steam to help loosen congestion. You can add a few drops of eucalyptus or peppermint essential oils to the water for extra relief. Cover your head with a towel to trap the steam and inhale deeply for a few minutes. 5. Take Over-the-Counter Medications: Medications like decongestants and antihistamines can provide temporary relief from congestion and runny nose. These are available over-the-counter at pharmacies or supermarkets. Be sure to follow the dosage instructions on the package. 6. Use a Humidifier: Adding moisture to the air with a humidifier can help soothe irritated nasal passages and relieve congestion.

Other civilizations were contemporary with the colonial period and were described in European historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the Maya civilization, had their own written records.

      "\n\nAdobe Photoshop: Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS. It was originally created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, this software has become the industry standard not only in raster graphics editing, but in digital art as a whole. The software's name has thus become a generic trademark, leading to its usage as a verb (e.g. \"to photoshop an image\", \"photoshopping\", and \"photoshop contest\") although Adobe discourages such use. Photoshop can edit and compose raster images in multiple layers and supports masks, alpha compositing, and several color models including RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, spot color, and duotone. Photoshop uses its own PSD and PSB file formats to support these features. In addition to raster graphics, this software has limited abilities to edit or render text and vector graphics (especially through clipping path for the latter), as well as 3D graphics and video. Its feature set can be expanded by plug-ins; programs developed and distributed independently of Photoshop that run inside it and offer new or enhanced features.",
      "\n\nHistory of chemistry: Around 420 BC, Empedocles stated that all matter is made up of four elemental substances: earth, fire, air and water. The early theory of atomism can be traced back to ancient Greece and ancient India. Greek atomism dates back to the Greek philosopher Democritus, who declared that matter is composed of indivisible and indestructible particles called \"atomos\" around 380 BC. Leucippus also declared that atoms were the most indivisible part of matter. This coincided with a similar declaration by Indian philosopher Kanada in his Vaisheshika sutras around the same time period. In much the same fashion he discussed the existence of gases. What Kanada declared by sutra, Democritus declared by philosophical musing. Both suffered from a lack of empirical data. Without scientific proof, the existence of atoms was easy to deny. Aristotle opposed the existence of atoms in 330 BC. Earlier, in 380 BC, a Greek text attributed to Polybus argued that the human body is composed of four humours. Around 300 BC, Epicurus postulated a universe of indestructible atoms in which man himself is responsible for achieving a balanced life."

      "\n\nQueen Victoria Building: The Queen Victoria Building (abbreviated as the QVB) is a heritage-listed late-nineteenth-century building designed by the architect George McRae located at 429-481 George Street in the Sydney central business district, in the Australian state of New South Wales. \nThe Romanesque Revival building was constructed between 1893 and 1898 and is 30 metres (98 ft) wide by 190 metres (620 ft) long. \nThe domes were built by Ritchie Brothers a steel and metal company that also built trains, trams and farm equipment. \nThe building fills a city block bounded by George, Market, York and Druitt Streets. \nDesigned as a marketplace, it was used for a variety of other purposes, underwent remodelling and suffered decay until its restoration and return to its original use in the late twentieth century. \nThe property is owned by the City of Sydney and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 March 2010. \nThe building, on the \"scale of a cathedral\" was designed by George McRae, a Scottish architect who had emigrated to Sydney in 1884. \nAt the time, Sydney was undergoing a building boom and since in architecture \"no one school or style predominated\", McRae produced four designs for the building in different styles (Gothic, Renaissance, Queen Anne and Romanesque) from which the Council could choose. \nThe Council's choice of Victorian Romanesque style conveys the influences of American architect Henry Hobson Richardson.

    "response": "Das Aussehen von Bögen kann auf verschiedene Epochen und Stile in der Archäologie und Kunst zurückgehen. Hier sind einige der bekanntesten Epochen, die Bögen verwendet haben:\n\n1. **Altsteinzeit (ca. 3,3 Millionen - 2700 v. Chr.)**: In dieser Periode wurden Bögen als einfache Werkzeuge für Jagd und Sammeln verwendet. Die frühesten Bögen sind typischerweise aus Holz, Knochen oder Stein gefertigt.\n\n2. **Jüngere Steinzeit (ca. 10.000 - 2700 v. Chr.)**: Mit der Entwicklung der Metallurgie begannen Menschen, Bögen aus Kupfer zu fertigen. Dies führte zu stärkeren und genauer handhabbaren Bögen.\n\n3. **Bronzezeit und Eisenzeit (ca. 3300 - 500 v. Chr.)**: In diesen Epochen wurden Bogen und Pfeil immer ausgefeilter, mit den Fortschritten in Metallverarbeitungstechniken. Kulturen wie die Römer, Griechen und Chinesen perfektionierten die Bogentechniken.\n\n4. **Antike (ca. 2500 v. Chr. - 500 n. Chr.)**: Die antiken Zivilisationen wie Ägypten, Mesopotamien, Griechenland und das Römische Reich nutzten Bögen in Kriegen und Jagd. Die Griechen entwickelten zum Beispiel das Bogen und die Pfeilwaffe als wesentliche Waffe für ihre Hopliten.\n\n5. **Mittelalter (ca. 500 - 1500 n. Chr.)**: In der mittelalterlichen Zeit wurden Bögen und Pfeile in Europa weiter verfeinert, mit dem Aufkommen des Langbogens und Pfeils, der durch die Einführung der Dartschaft und des Pfeilspitzes revolutionär war.\n\n6. **Renaissance und Frühe Neuzeit (ca. 1400 - 1800 n. Chr.)**: Diese Zeit war geprägt von Innovationen in Bogentechniken, darunter die Entwicklung des Scharfschützenbogens und der Verbesserung der Bogentechniken, die im Zeitalter der Entdeckungen und Kriege entscheidend waren.\n\n7. **Moderne (ab 18. Jahrhundert) bis heute**: Die moderne Ära sah die Entwicklung von massenproduzierten Bogen, insbesondere mit dem Aufkommen von Stahl und später Verbundwerkstoffen. Die moderne Bogentechnologie wird in Jägersport, Schießsport und sogar in einigen militärischen Anwendungen weiterentwickelt.\n\nDas Aussehen eines Bogens kann von seiner Form, seiner Größe, den verwendeten Materialien und den spezifischen Verwendungszwecken abhängen. Ohne ein konkretes Beispiel ist es jedoch schwierig, eine bestimmte Ära genau zu bestimmen.

    "response": "Bei der Erklärung von Teilchenkollisionen, insbesondere in Bezug auf Relativitätstheorie und Quantenmechanik, müssen mehrere wichtige Aspekte berücksichtigt werden:\n\n1. **Relativitätstheorie (Special und General Relativity)**: Bei hohen Geschwindigkeiten, nahe der Lichtgeschwindigkeit, ist es notwendig, die relativistischen Effekte zu berücksichtigen. Die Längenkompression, oder Längenkontraktion, tritt auf, sodass sich Partikel in einem relativistischen Kontext kürzer anfühlen als im Ruhezustand. Dies kann die Dynamik der Kollision beeinflussen.\n\n2. **Quantenmechanik**: Teilchen unterliegen Quantenmechanik und besitzen Wellen-Teilchen-Dualität. Die Interaktion von Teilchen kann nicht vollständig durch klassische Mechanik beschrieben werden; stattdessen müssen Quantenzustände und Wahrscheinlichkeiten berücksichtigt werden.\n\n3. **Kollisionsenergie**: Die Energie, die während einer Kollision freigesetzt wird, kann in verschiedene Formen zerlegt werden, wie Gammastrahlung, Neutrinos, Partikelausstoß etc. Die spezifische Zerlegung hängt von der Art der Kollision und den beteiligten Teilchen ab.\n\n4. **Betrachtete Teilchen**: Die Eigenschaften der beteiligten Teilchen (wie Protonen, Neutronen, Elektronen, Quarks etc.) und ihre Wechselwirkungen, wie durch die starke und schwache Kernkraft, spielen eine wesentliche Rolle. Quarks sind beispielsweise in Hadronen wie Protonen und Neutronen gebunden.\n\n5. **Koordinaten und Symmetrieprinzipien**: Die Wahl der Koordinaten (z.B. Ruhekoordinaten, Relativistische Koordinaten) und die Symmetrieprinzipien (z.B. Lorentz-Symmetrie) können die Analyse vereinfachen und die relevanten physikalischen Eigenschaften hervorheben.\n\n6. **Statistische Mechanik der Materie**: Bei Teilchenkollisionen, insbesondere in Kernreaktoren oder Kosmischen Neutrino-Detektoren, ist die statistische Behandlung der Teilchenpopulation wichtig.\n\n7. **Betrachtete Energieskala**: Die Energieskala der Kollision kann unterschiedliche physikalische Phänomene hervorbringen, von der Quark-Gluon-Plasma bei sehr hohen Energien bis hin zu subatomaren Teilcheneffekten bei niedrigeren Energien.\n\nDiese Aspekte können dazu beitragen, Teilchenkollisionen besser zu verstehen und zu beschreiben.",

      "\n\nFree-culture movement: In 1998, the United States Congress passed the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act which President Clinton signed into law. The legislation extended copyright protections for twenty additional years, resulting in a total guaranteed copyright term of seventy years after a creator's death. The bill was heavily lobbied by music and film corporations like Disney, and dubbed as the Mickey Mouse Protection Act. Lawrence Lessig claims copyright is an obstacle to cultural production, knowledge sharing and technological innovation, and that private interests – as opposed to public good – determine law. He travelled the country in 1998, giving as many as a hundred speeches a year at college campuses, and sparked the movement. It led to the foundation of the first chapter of the Students for Free Culture at Swarthmore College.",

Dieser Schritt war entscheidend dafür, das schnelle Wachstum des Webs zu fördern und den Wechsel von anderen Hypertext-Systemen wie Gopher hin zum World Wide Web zu ermöglichen.",
    "retrieved_contexts": [
      "\n\nWorld Wide Web: the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).The World Wide Web had several differences from other hypertext systems available at the time. The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of link rot. Unlike predecessors such as HyperCard, the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due. Coming two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the Gopher protocol was no longer free to use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and towards the Web. An early popular web browser was ViolaWWW for Unix and the X Window System.",

She transferred to San Jose State College, where she became a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, to study occupational therapy, receiving her bachelor's degree in 1954. Initially following her college major, Fossey began a career in occupational therapy. She interned at various hospitals in California and worked with tuberculosis patients. Fossey was originally a prizewinning equestrian, which drew her to Kentucky in 1955, and a year later took a job as an occupational therapist at the Kosair Crippled Children's Hospital in Louisville.Her shy and reserved personality allowed her to work well with the children at the hospital. Fossey became close with her coworker Mary White \"Gaynee\" Henry, secretary to the hospital's chief administrator and the wife of one of the doctors, Michael J. Henry. The Henrys invited Fossey to join them on their family farm, where she worked with livestock on a daily basis and also experienced an inclusive family atmosphere that had been missing for most of her life.
