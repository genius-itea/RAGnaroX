    "response": "Pappataci fever, caused by the Pappataci virus, does not go away on its own over time. It requires medical treatment. The disease is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected Phlebotomus sandflies. The symptoms typically include high fever, severe headache, muscle pain, and fatigue. In some cases, it can also cause bleeding from the gums or nose, and in severe cases, it can lead to organ failure and death.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for Pappataci fever, and the disease can be severe and potentially life-threatening. In areas where Pappataci fever is endemic, efforts are often made to control the sandfly population and prevent their bites, such as using insect repellents and bed nets, as well as spraying insecticides in areas where sandflies are known to breed. In the event of an infection, supportive care is provided, and in some cases, antiviral medications may be prescribed.\n\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare professional if you suspect that you have been infected with Pappataci fever or if you have been bitten by a sandfly in an endemic area. Early detection and treatment can improve the chances of a full recovery.",

      "\n\nPappataci fever: Pappataci fever is prevalent in the subtropical zone of the Eastern Hemisphere between 20°N and 45°N, particularly in Southern Europe, North Africa, the Balkans, Eastern Mediterranean, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and India.The disease is transmitted by the bites of phlebotomine sandflies of the Genus Phlebotomus, in particular, Phlebotomus papatasi, Phlebotomus perniciosus and Phlebotomus perfiliewi. The sandfly becomes infected when biting an infected human in the period between 48 hours before the onset of fever and 24 hours after the end of the fever, and remains infected for its lifetime. Besides this horizontal virus transmission from man to sandfly, the virus can be transmitted in insects transovarially, from an infected female sandfly to its offspring.Pappataci fever is seldom recognised in endemic populations because it is mixed with other febrile illnesses of childhood, but it is more well-known among immigrants and military personnel from non-endemic regions.",
      "\n\nMycobacterium marinum: Although Aronson isolated this mycobacterium in 1926 from a fish, it was not until 1951 that it was found to be the cause of human disease by Linell and Norden. Large outbreaks of infection due to this atypical mycobacterium have been described in association with swimming. Infections related to swimming pools have now drastically fallen due to the improvements in the construction and maintenance of these facilities.The first case of M. marinum infection associated with a fish-tank ('fish-tank granuloma') was reported in 1962 by Swift and Cohen. M. marinum infection may be an occupational hazard for certain professions such as pet shop workers, but most infections occur in fish fanciers who keep an aquarium at home. Although infection may be caused by direct injury from the fish fins or bites, most are acquired during the handling of the aquariums such as cleaning or changing the water. Indirect infection has also been described related to a child’s bathing utensils that had been used to clean a fish tank. Due to an increased awareness of the disease and improved isolation methods, more and more cases are being recognized and reported worldwide.",

    "reference": "vertical synchronization and retrace",
    "response": "CRT (cathode-ray tube) TVs needed a vertical blanking interval for synchronization and retrace purposes. Here's a brief explanation:\n\n1. **Vertical Sync (V-Sync):** This signal tells the TV when to start drawing a new frame from the top, effectively \"blacking out\" the screen for a short period. It ensures that the electron beam in the CRT starts drawing from a known point, which helps in maintaining a consistent image on the screen.\n\n2. **Retrace Time:** After the electron beam reaches the end of the screen, it needs to move back to the left side to start drawing the next line. This time is known as retrace. The vertical blanking interval provides the time for this movement without drawing any visible spots on the screen.\n\nWithout the vertical blanking interval, the electron beam would draw spots on the screen during retrace, leading to a flickering and unstable image. The blanking interval also allows for the vertical synchronization of the TV signal, which ensures that the TV's display is in sync with the incoming video signal.\n\nIn summary, the vertical blanking interval in CRT TVs was crucial for maintaining a stable and flicker-free image by providing the necessary time for vertical synchronization and beam retrace.",

",
      "\n\nNTSC: NTSC color encoding is used with the System M television signal, which consists of ​30⁄1.001 (approximately 29.97) interlaced frames of video per second. \nEach frame is composed of two fields, each consisting of 262.5 scan lines, for a total of 525 scan lines. 486 scan lines make up the visible raster. \nThe remainder (the vertical blanking interval) allow for vertical synchronization and retrace. \nThis blanking interval was originally designed to simply blank the receiver's CRT to allow for the simple analog circuits and slow vertical retrace of early TV receivers. \nHowever, some of these lines may now contain other data such as closed captioning and vertical interval timecode (VITC). \nIn the complete raster (disregarding half lines due to interlacing) the even-numbered scan lines (every other line that would be even if counted in the video signal, e.g. \n{2, 4, 6, ..., 524}) are drawn in the first field, and the odd-numbered (every other line that would be odd if counted in the video signal, e.g. \n{1, 3, 5, ..., 525}) are drawn in the second field, to yield a flicker-free image at the field refresh frequency of ​60⁄1.001 Hz (approximately 59.94 Hz).

Small blood vessels are essential for delivering oxygen and nutrients to tissues, including nerves. In diabetes, high blood sugar levels can cause damage to these vessels, leading to:\n\n1. Reduced blood flow: This can result in insufficient oxygen and nutrients reaching nerve cells, impairing their function and survival.\n\n2. Increased blood vessel permeability: This can lead to leakage and edema, further damaging nerves.\n\n3.

      "\n\nIn the case of diabetic autonomic neuropathy, it is due to the failure of the heart and arteries to appropriately adjust heart rate and vascular tone to keep blood continually and fully flowing to the brain.  \nThis symptom is usually accompanied by a loss of respiratory sinus arrhythmia – the usual change in heart rate seen with normal breathing. \nThese two findings suggest autonomic neuropathy. \nThe main risk factor for diabetic neuropathy is hyperglycemia.  \nIn the DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, 1995) study, the annual incidence of neuropathy was 2% per year but dropped to 0.56% with intensive treatment of Type 1 diabetics. \nThe progression of neuropathy is dependent on the degree of glycemic control in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. \nDuration of diabetes, age, cigarette smoking, hypertension, height, and hyperlipidemia are also risk factors for diabetic neuropathy. \nVascular and neural diseases are closely related and intertwined. \nBlood vessels depend on normal nerve function, and nerves depend on adequate blood flow. \nThe first pathological change in the small blood vessels is narrowing of the blood vessels. \nAs the disease progresses, neuronal dysfunction correlates closely with the development of blood vessel abnormalities, such as capillary basement membrane thickening and endothelial hyperplasia, which contribute to diminished oxygen tension and hypoxia. \nNeuronal ischemia is a well-established characteristic of diabetic neuropathy.

      "\n\nA pins and needles sensation is common. \nLoss of proprioception, the sense of where a limb is in space, is affected early. \nThese patients cannot feel when they are stepping on a foreign body, like a splinter, or when they are developing a callous from an ill-fitting shoe. \nConsequently, they are at risk of developing ulcers and infections on the feet and legs, which can lead to amputation. \nSimilarly, these patients can get multiple fractures of the knee, ankle or foot, and develop a Charcot joint. \nLoss of motor function results in dorsiflexion, contractures of the toes, loss of the interosseous muscle function that leads to contraction of the digits, so-called hammer toes. \nThese contractures occur not only in the foot but also in the hand where the loss of the musculature makes the hand appear gaunt and skeletal. \nThe loss of muscular function is progressive. \nThe autonomic nervous system is composed of nerves serving the heart, lungs, blood vessels, bone, adipose tissue, sweat glands, gastrointestinal system and genitourinary system. \nAutonomic neuropathy can affect any of these organ systems. \nThe most commonly recognized autonomic dysfunction in diabetics is orthostatic hypotension, or becoming dizzy and possibly fainting when standing up due to a sudden drop in blood pressure. ",
      "\n\nDiabetic neuropathy: Diabetic neuropathy affects all peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, but rarely affects the autonomic nervous system.  \nTherefore, diabetic neuropathy can affect all organs and systems, as all are innervated. \nThere are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems and members affected, but these are by no means exclusive. \nA patient can have sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy or any other combination. \nSigns and symptoms vary depending on the nerve(s) affected and may include symptoms other than those listed. \nSymptoms usually develop gradually over years. \nGlobally diabetic neuropathy affects approximately 132 million people as of 2010 (1.9% of the population).\nDiabetes is the leading known cause of neuropathy in developed countries, and neuropathy is the most common complication and greatest source of morbidity and mortality in diabetes. \nIt is estimated that neuropathy affects 25% of people with diabetes. \nDiabetic neuropathy is implicated in 50–75% of nontraumatic amputations. \nLonger nerve fibers are affected to a greater degree than shorter ones because nerve conduction velocity is slowed in proportion to a nerve's length. \nIn this syndrome, decreased sensation and loss of reflexes occurs first in the toes on each foot, then extends upward. \nIt is usually described as a glove-stocking distribution of numbness, sensory loss, dysesthesia and night time pain. \nThe pain can feel like burning, pricking sensation, achy or dull.

For example, uranium-238 can decay into thorium-234 through alpha decay, changing it from one element to another.

      "\n\nAccording to Plato, the four elements are derived from a common source or prima materia (first matter), associated with chaos. \nPrima materia is also the name alchemists assign to the starting ingredient for the creation of the philosopher's stone. \nThe importance of this philosophical first matter persisted throughout the history of alchemy. \nIn the seventeenth century, Thomas Vaughan writes, \"the first matter of the stone is the very same with the first matter of all things\". \nThe philosopher's stone, more properly philosophers' stone or stone of the philosophers (Latin: lapis philosophorum) is a legendary alchemical substance capable of turning base metals such as mercury into gold (chrysopoeia, from the Greek χρυσός khrusos, \"gold\", and ποιεῖν poiēin, \"to make\") or silver. \nIt is also called the elixir of life, useful for rejuvenation and for achieving immortality; for many centuries, it was the most sought goal in alchemy. \nThe philosopher's stone was the central symbol of the mystical terminology of alchemy, symbolizing perfection at its finest, enlightenment, and heavenly bliss. \nEfforts to discover the philosopher's stone were known as the Magnum Opus (\"Great Work\").",
      "\n\nPhilosopher's stone: Early medieval alchemists built upon the work of Zosimos in the Byzantine Empire and the Arab empires. \nByzantine and Arab alchemists were fascinated by the concept of metal transmutation and attempted to carry out the process. \nThe 8th-century Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan (Latinized as Geber) analyzed each classical element in terms of the four basic qualities. \nFire was both hot and dry, earth cold and dry, water cold and moist, and air hot and moist. \nHe theorized that every metal was a combination of these four principles, two of them interior and two exterior. \nFrom this premise, it was reasoned that the transmutation of one metal into another could be affected by the rearrangement of its basic qualities. \nThis change would be mediated by a substance, which came to be called xerion in Greek and al-iksir in Arabic (from which the word elixir is derived). \nIt was often considered to exist as a dry red powder (also known as al-kibrit al-ahmar, red sulfur) made from a legendary stone—the philosopher's stone. \nThe elixir powder came to be regarded as a crucial component of transmutation by later Arab alchemists.In the 11th century, there was a debate among Muslim world chemists on whether the transmutation of substances was possible.

It was built first in 1800 by Sultan Selim III for the soldiers of the newly established  Nizam-ı Cedid (literally \"New Order\") in frame of the Ottoman military reform efforts. The initially wooden barracks was designed by Krikor Balyan. It was burnt down in 1806 by revolting Janissaries, who were against the reforms. Ordered by Sultan Mahmud II, rebuilding of the barracks in stone began in 1825 and it was completed on 6 February 1828. It is a gigantic rectangle building 200 m × 267 m (656 ft × 876 ft) with a large parade ground in the centre. The structure has three floors on three wings and two floors only on the eastern wing due to inclined terrain. During the reign of Sultan Abdülmecid I, the barracks were renovated twice, first in 1842–43 and again in 1849–50. During this process, a tower seven stories in height was added to each of the four corners, giving the barracks the look they have today.",

    "reference": "athetoid",
    "response": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders that affect a person's ability to move and maintain balance and posture. It is the most common motor disability in children. Cerebral palsy is caused by abnormal brain development or damage to the developing brain that affects a person's ability to control his or her muscles.\n\nCerebral palsy is not caused by a disease of the muscles but rather by a disorder of the brain. It is not a disease itself, but a manifestation of brain damage. The brain damage that causes cerebral palsy may occur before, during, or shortly after birth. Factors such as infections, oxygen deprivation, or bleeding in the brain can lead to cerebral palsy.\n\nCerebral palsy can also be acquired after birth, which is known as perinatal cerebral palsy. This can happen as a result of a head injury or other types of trauma to the brain during birth, such as a difficult delivery.\n\nThere are different types of cerebral palsy, which depend on the part of the brain that is affected and the severity of the brain damage. The most common types are:\n\n1. Spastic cerebral palsy: This is the most common type of cerebral palsy, affecting about 80% of people with the condition. It is characterized by tight or stiff muscles and exaggerated reflexes. People with spastic cerebral palsy may have trouble with movement and coordination.\n\n2. Athetoid or dyskinetic cerebral palsy: This type of cerebral palsy causes uncontrolled movements that may be slow or rapid. People with athetotid cerebral palsy may have difficulty with fine motor tasks.\n\n3. Ataxic cerebral palsy: This type of cerebral palsy affects a person's balance and coordination. People with ataxic cerebral palsy may appear clumsy and have a hard time walking.\n\n4. Mixed cerebral palsy: This type of cerebral palsy involves a combination of two or more of the other types.\n\nCerebral palsy is a lifelong condition, but many people with cerebral palsy can live active and fulfilling lives. Treatment for cerebral palsy typically involves physical and occupational therapy, medication, and sometimes surgery or other medical interventions. The goals of treatment are to improve a person's mobility, reduce symptoms, and help them achieve their fullest potential.",

He was also a patron of the arts and was an accomplished musician, playing the harpsichord and the flute.

Collectively, the MacBook brand is the \"world's top-selling line of premium laptops.\"There have been four separate designs of the MacBook. The original model used a combination of polycarbonate and fiberglass casing which was modeled after the iBook G4. The second type was introduced in October 2008 alongside the 15-inch MacBook Pro; the MacBook shared the more expensive laptop's unibody aluminium casing, but omitted FireWire.

The web revolutionized how people access and share information.\n\n2. **Mobile Phones**: Nokia released the Nokia 601, one of the first mobile phones with a color screen and a built-in camera, in 1994. However, it wasn't until the mid-1990s that mobile phones became more widely accessible to the general public.\n\n3. **Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs)**: Devices like the PalmPilot, introduced in 1996, became popular for personal organization and internet access.\n\n4. **DVDs**: Sony and Philips introduced the first DVD players in 1997, offering a higher-quality video format than VHS tapes.\n\n5. **Bluetooth Technology**: Developed by Ericsson, Bluetooth technology was introduced in 1999 to enable wireless communication between devices over short distances.\n\n6. **Social Media**: The late 1990s saw the emergence of early social media platforms like Friendster (launched in 2002) and MySpace (launched in 2003), but the seeds of social media were sown in this decade.\n\n7. **Gaming Consoles**: Sony PlayStation, launched in 1994, and Nintendo 64, released in 1996, were groundbreaking gaming consoles that shaped the video game industry.\n\n8. **Wi-Fi**: The IEEE 802.11 standard for wireless networking was ratified in 1997, leading to the development of Wi-Fi technology, which became widely available in the following years.\n\n9. **Dot-com Boom**: The early to mid-1990s experienced a rapid growth in internet-based companies, known as the dot-com boom, with numerous startups emerging around the World Wide Web.\n\n10. **Digital Cameras**: Digital cameras began to emerge in the 1990s, with companies like Kodak and Fuji introducing models that allowed for instant digital photo viewing.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many innovations and introductions that occurred in the 1990s.",

The Presidential Council, the country's Communist-era collective presidency, was dissolved. Under the Constitution, Szűrös became provisional president until the election. Soon after taking office on 23 October he made the official proclamation that Hungary had removed the \"People's Republic\" from its constitutional name and was now the \"Republic of Hungary.\"",

      "\n\nGeneral Packet Radio Service: GPRS is a best-effort service, implying variable throughput and latency that depend on the number of other users sharing the service concurrently, as opposed to circuit switching, where a certain quality of service (QoS) is guaranteed during the connection.  In 2G systems, GPRS provides data rates of 56–114 kbit/sec. 2G cellular technology combined with GPRS is sometimes described as 2.5G, that is, a technology between the second (2G) and third (3G) generations of mobile telephony. It provides moderate-speed data transfer, by using unused time division multiple access (TDMA) channels in, for example, the GSM system. GPRS is integrated into GSM Release 97 and newer releases. Using the CS-4 it is possible to achieve a user speed of 20.0 kbit/s per time slot. However, using this scheme the cell coverage is 25% of normal. CS-1 can achieve a user speed of only 8.0 kbit/s per time slot, but has 98% of normal coverage. Newer network equipment can adapt the transfer speed automatically depending on the mobile location."

      "\n\nObelisks functioned in much the same manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. \nThe obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the summer and winter solstices. \nA third shadow clock, developed c. \n1500 BC, was similar in shape to a bent T-square. \nIt measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. \nThe T was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at noon, so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.Although accurate, shadow clocks relied on the sun, and so were useless at night and in cloudy weather. \nThe Egyptians therefore developed a number of alternative timekeeping instruments, including water clocks, and a system for tracking star movements. \nThe oldest description of a water clock is from the tomb inscription of the 16th-century BC Egyptian court official Amenemhet, identifying him as its inventor. \nThere were several types of water clocks, some more elaborate than others. \nOne type consisted of a bowl with small holes in its bottom, which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near-constant rate; markings on the side of the bowl indicated elapsed time, as the surface of the water reached them. \nThe oldest-known waterclock was found in the tomb of pharaoh Amenhotep I (1525–1504 BC), suggesting that they were first used in ancient Egypt.

Larka became the first Minister of War of Republic of Estonia; in March he achieved rank of Major General. In 1918, during the German occupation, he participated in organising the Defence League. After the start of the Estonian Liberation War in 1918, Larka soon moved from position of Minister of War to Chief of Staff. In February 1919 he became the aide of the Minister of War and held that position to the beginning of 1925. In that position his job was to organize mobilization and actions of reserve units. After the war he also organized demobilization. He retired in 1925 because of health issues. In 1930 he became official leader of the League of Liberators and was their candidate in the April 1934 presidential elections. But on 12 March 1934, as it seemed likely that Larka would be elected, Konstantin Päts and Johan Laidoner made a coup d'état in order to prevent him from winning the elections. The elections were postponed indefinitely, Larka and about 400 of his closest supporters were imprisoned and authoritarian rule was established. Larka was in prison twice (1934-1935 and 1935-1937).

    "reference": "objects interacting with already-coloured light",
    "response": "The perception of color originates from the way our eyes respond to different wavelengths of light. When light strikes an object, certain wavelengths are absorbed while others are reflected. The reflected wavelengths enter our eyes and are detected by photoreceptor cells in the retina called cones. These cones are sensitive to different ranges of wavelengths, which correspond to the colors red, green, and blue. The brain processes the signals from these cells to create the perception of color.\n\nIn terms of light itself, color is not an inherent property of light but rather a characteristic of the way light interacts with matter. For example, when white light (which contains all colors) shines on an object, the object absorbs some wavelengths and reflects others. The reflected wavelengths are what we see as the color of the object. Different materials and surfaces reflect different wavelengths, which is why they appear to have different colors.\n\nIn summary, color perception arises from the interaction between light and matter, with our eyes and brains interpreting the reflected light to perceive the world in vibrant hues.",

      "\n\nIn 1665, he discovered the generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became calculus. \nSoon after Newton had obtained his BA degree in August 1665, the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the Great Plague. \nAlthough he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student, Newton's private studies at his home in Woolsthorpe over the subsequent two years saw the development of his theories on calculus, optics, and the law of gravitation. \nIt is known from his notebooks that Newton was grappling in the late 1660s with the idea that terrestrial gravity extends, in an inverse-square proportion, to the Moon; however it took him two decades to develop the full-fledged theory. \nThe question was not whether gravity existed, but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the Moon to its orbit. \nNewton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon's orbital period, and get good agreement. \nHe guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it \"universal gravitation\". \nJohn Conduitt, Newton's assistant at the Royal Mint and husband of Newton's niece, also described the event when he wrote about Newton's life: Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum.

      "\n\nIn adolescents, it has been proposed that hypertension and pre-hypertension are diagnosed and classified using the same criteria as in adults.The value of routine screening for hypertension in children over the age of 3 years is debated. \nIn 2004 the National High Blood Pressure Education Program recommended that children aged 3 years and older have blood pressure measurement at In people aged 18 years or older hypertension is defined as either a systolic or a diastolic blood pressure measurement consistently higher than an accepted normal value (this is above 129 or 139 mmHg systolic, 89 mmHg diastolic depending on the guideline). \nOther thresholds are used (135 mmHg systolic or 85 mmHg diastolic) if measurements are derived from 24-hour ambulatory or home monitoring. \nRecent international hypertension guidelines have also created categories below the hypertensive range to indicate a continuum of risk with higher blood pressures in the normal range. \nThe Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7) published in 2003 uses the term prehypertension for blood pressure in the range 120–139 mmHg systolic or 80–89 mmHg diastolic, while European Society of Hypertension Guidelines (2007) and British Hypertension Society (BHS) IV (2004) use optimal, normal and high normal categories to subdivide pressures below 140 mmHg systolic and 90 mmHg diastolic.

      "\n\nFifth force: A new fundamental force might be difficult to test. Gravity, for example, is such a weak force that the gravitational interaction between two objects is only significant when one of them has a great mass. Therefore, it takes very sensitive equipment to measure gravitational interactions between objects that are small compared to the Earth. A new (or \"fifth\") fundamental force might similarly be weak and therefore difficult to detect. Nonetheless, in the late 1980s a fifth force, operating on municipal scales (i.e. with a range of about 100 meters), was reported by researchers (Fischbach et al.) who were reanalyzing results of Loránd Eötvös from earlier in the century. The force was believed to be linked with hypercharge. Over a number of years, other experiments have failed to duplicate this result.There are at least three kinds of searches that can be undertaken, which depend on the kind of force being considered, and its range. Some speculative theories have proposed a fifth force to explain various anomalous observations that do not fit existing theories.  The characteristics of this fifth force depend on the theory being advanced. Many postulate a force roughly the strength of gravity (i.e. it is much weaker than electromagnetism or the nuclear forces) with a range of anywhere from less than a millimeter to cosmological scales. Another proposal is a new weak force, mediated by W′ and Z′ bosons.",

This condition can result in difficulty with facial movements, including expressions, blinking, and closing the eye on the affected side. Bell's palsy typically occurs in people between the ages of 15 and 60, and while the exact cause is not always known, it is considered a form of temporary facial paralysis. In most cases, the symptoms improve within weeks to months, but some people may experience lingering effects or recurrent episodes. It is important to note that Bell's palsy is different from other neurological conditions that can also impact facial movements, such as stroke, brain tumors, or traumatic brain injuries.

      "\n\nAt the base of classical mechanics is the notion that a body's motion can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion. \nSuch deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. \nThe preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. \nIn modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.Conversely, one might expect that inertial motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), can be used to define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate. \nHowever, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. \nAccording to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors (see Eötvös experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties.

Here are the common methods used to detect hypertension:\n\n1. **Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure Measurement**: This is the standard way to measure blood pressure. The systolic pressure (the top number) measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats, and the diastolic pressure (the bottom number) measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart is at rest between beats. A reading of 140/90 mm Hg or higher is generally considered hypertensive.\n\n2. **Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM)**: This involves wearing a blood pressure monitor for 24 hours to measure your blood pressure at regular intervals throughout the day and night.\n\n3. **Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM)**: This involves using a blood pressure monitor at home to measure your blood pressure over several days or weeks.\n\n4. **Cuffless Devices**: These devices use optical sensors to measure blood pressure without a cuff, but they are not yet as widely accepted as gold standard as cuff-based devices.\n\nIf you have a blood pressure reading above 140/90 mm Hg on two different occasions, you may be diagnosed with hypertension. However, it's important to note that a single reading may not be enough to diagnose hypertension, especially if it's a one-time occurrence. Regular monitoring is essential.

      "\n\nThe discovery of the star in the Milky Way galaxy suggests that the galaxy may be at least 3 billion years older than previously thought.Several individual stars have been found in the Milky Way's halo with measured ages very close to the 13.80-billion-year age of the Universe. \nIn 2007, a star in the galactic halo, HE 1523-0901, was estimated to be about 13.2 billion years old. \nAs the oldest known object in the Milky Way at that time, this measurement placed a lower limit on the age of the Milky Way. \nThis estimate was made using the UV-Visual Echelle Spectrograph of the Very Large Telescope to measure the relative strengths of spectral lines caused by the presence of thorium and other elements created by the R-process. \nThe line strengths yield abundances of different elemental isotopes, from which an estimate of the age of the star can be derived using nucleocosmochronology. \nAnother star, HD 140283, is 14.5 ± 0.7 billion years old.According to observations utilizing adaptive optics to correct for Earth's atmospheric distortion, stars in the galaxy's bulge date to about 12.8 billion years old.The age of stars in the galactic thin disk has also been estimated using nucleocosmochronology. \nMeasurements of thin disk stars yield an estimate that the thin disk formed 8.8 ± 1.7 billion years ago. ",
      "\n\nMilky Way: Globular clusters are among the oldest objects in the Milky Way, which thus set a lower limit on the age of the Milky Way. \nThe ages of individual stars in the Milky Way can be estimated by measuring the abundance of long-lived radioactive elements such as thorium-232 and uranium-238, then comparing the results to estimates of their original abundance, a technique called nucleocosmochronology. \nThese yield values of about 12.5 ± 3 billion years for CS 31082-001 and 13.8 ± 4 billion years for BD +17° 3248. \nOnce a white dwarf is formed, it begins to undergo radiative cooling and the surface temperature steadily drops. \nBy measuring the temperatures of the coolest of these white dwarfs and comparing them to their expected initial temperature, an age estimate can be made. \nWith this technique, the age of the globular cluster M4 was estimated as 12.7 ± 0.7 billion years. \nAge estimates of the oldest of these clusters gives a best fit estimate of 12.6 billion years, and a 95% confidence upper limit of 16 billion years.In November 2018, astronomers reported the discovery of one of the oldest stars in the universe. \nAbout 13.5 billion-years-old, 2MASS J18082002-5104378 B is a tiny ultra metal-poor (UMP) star made almost entirely of materials released from the Big Bang, and is possibly one of the very first stars.

      "\n\nGeorge III of the United Kingdom: A brief lull in hostilities allowed Pitt to concentrate effort on Ireland, where there had been an uprising and attempted French landing in 1798. \nIn 1800, the British and Irish Parliaments passed an Act of Union that took effect on 1 January 1801 and united Great Britain and Ireland into a single state, known as the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\". \nGeorge used the opportunity to abandon the title \"king of France\", which English and British Sovereigns had maintained since the reign of Edward III. \nIt was suggested that George adopt the title \"Emperor of the British Isles\", but he refused. \nAs part of his Irish policy, Pitt planned to remove certain legal disabilities that applied to Roman Catholics. \nGeorge III claimed that to emancipate Catholics would be to violate his coronation oath, in which Sovereigns promise to maintain Protestantism. \nFaced with opposition to his religious reform policies from both the King and the British public, Pitt threatened to resign. \nAt about the same time, the King had a relapse of his previous illness, which he blamed on worry over the Catholic question. \nOn 14 March 1801, Pitt was formally replaced by the Speaker of the House of Commons, Henry Addington. \nAddington opposed emancipation, instituted annual accounts, abolished income tax and began a programme of disarmament. \nIn October 1801, he made peace with the French, and in 1802 signed the Treaty of Amiens.George did not consider the peace with France as real; in his view it was an \"experiment\".

      "\n\nThe Proclamation Line did not bother the majority of settled farmers, but it was unpopular with a vocal minority and ultimately contributed to conflict between the colonists and the British government. \nWith the American colonists generally unburdened by British taxes, the government thought it appropriate for them to pay towards the defence of the colonies against native uprisings and the possibility of French incursions. \nThe central issue for the colonists was not the amount of taxes but whether Parliament could levy a tax without American approval, for there were no American seats in Parliament. \nThe Americans protested that like all Englishmen they had rights to \"no taxation without representation\". \nIn 1765, Grenville introduced the Stamp Act, which levied a stamp duty on every document in the British colonies in North America. \nSince newspapers were printed on stamped paper, those most affected by the introduction of the duty were the most effective at producing propaganda opposing the tax. \nMeanwhile, the King had become exasperated at Grenville's attempts to reduce the King's prerogatives, and tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade William Pitt the Elder to accept the office of Prime Minister. \nAfter a brief illness, which may have presaged his illnesses to come, George settled on Lord Rockingham to form a ministry, and dismissed Grenville. \nMeanwhile, George's health deteriorated. \nHe developed dementia, and became completely blind and increasingly deaf.

      "\n\nFrench colonial empire: In the middle of the 18th century, a series of colonial conflicts began between France and Britain, which ultimately resulted in the destruction of most of the first French colonial empire and the near-complete expulsion of France from the Americas. These wars were the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the American Revolution (1765–1783), the French Revolutionary Wars (1793–1802) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815). It may even be seen further back in time to the first of the French and Indian Wars. This cyclic conflict is sometimes known as the Second Hundred Years' War. The French colonial empire began to fall during the Second World War, when various parts were occupied by foreign powers (Japan in Indochina, Britain in Syria, Lebanon, and Madagascar, the United States and Britain in Morocco and Algeria, and Germany and Italy in Tunisia). However, control was gradually reestablished by Charles de Gaulle. The French Union, included in the Constitution of 1946, nominally replaced the former colonial empire, but officials in Paris remained in full control. The colonies were given local assemblies with only limited local power and budgets. There emerged a group of elites, known as evolués, who were natives of the overseas territories but lived in metropolitan France."

      "\n\nThe Proclamation Line did not bother the majority of settled farmers, but it was unpopular with a vocal minority and ultimately contributed to conflict between the colonists and the British government. \nWith the American colonists generally unburdened by British taxes, the government thought it appropriate for them to pay towards the defence of the colonies against native uprisings and the possibility of French incursions. \nThe central issue for the colonists was not the amount of taxes but whether Parliament could levy a tax without American approval, for there were no American seats in Parliament. \nThe Americans protested that like all Englishmen they had rights to \"no taxation without representation\". \nIn 1765, Grenville introduced the Stamp Act, which levied a stamp duty on every document in the British colonies in North America. \nSince newspapers were printed on stamped paper, those most affected by the introduction of the duty were the most effective at producing propaganda opposing the tax. \nMeanwhile, the King had become exasperated at Grenville's attempts to reduce the King's prerogatives, and tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade William Pitt the Elder to accept the office of Prime Minister. \nAfter a brief illness, which may have presaged his illnesses to come, George settled on Lord Rockingham to form a ministry, and dismissed Grenville. \nMeanwhile, George's health deteriorated. \nHe developed dementia, and became completely blind and increasingly deaf.

      "\n\nIn the opinion of modern scholars, during the long reign of George III the monarchy continued to lose its political power, and grew as the embodiment of national morality. \nGeorge III is often accused of obstinately trying to keep Great Britain at war with the revolutionaries in America, despite the opinions of his own ministers. \nIn the words of the Victorian author George Trevelyan, the King was determined \"never to acknowledge the independence of the Americans, and to punish their contumacy by the indefinite prolongation of a war which promised to be eternal.\" \nThe King wanted to \"keep the rebels harassed, anxious, and poor, until the day when, by a natural and inevitable process, discontent and disappointment were converted into penitence and remorse\". \nHowever, more recent historians defend George by saying in the context of the times no king would willingly surrender such a large territory, and his conduct was far less ruthless than contemporary monarchs in Europe. \nAfter Saratoga, both Parliament and the British people were in favour of the war; recruitment ran at high levels and although political opponents were vocal, they remained a small minority. \nWith the setbacks in America, Prime Minister Lord North asked to transfer power to Lord Chatham, whom he thought more capable, but George refused to do so; he suggested instead that Chatham serve as a subordinate minister in Lord North's administration, but Chatham refused to co-operate. \nHe died later in the same year.

      "\n\nOne country, two systems: \"One country, two systems\" is a constitutional principle formulated by Deng Xiaoping, the Paramount Leader of the People's Republic of China (PRC), for the reunification of China during the early 1980s. He suggested that there would be only one China, but distinct Chinese regions such as Hong Kong and Macau could retain their own economic and administrative systems, while the rest of the PRC (or simply \"China\") uses the socialism with Chinese characteristics system. Under the principle, each of the two regions could continue to have its own governmental system, legal, economic and financial affairs, including trade relations with foreign countries. Deng Xiaoping proposed to apply the principle to Hong Kong in the negotiation with the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher over the future of Hong Kong when the lease of the New Territories (including New Kowloon) of Hong Kong to the United Kingdom was to expire in 1997. The same principle was proposed in talks with Portugal about Macau.",

Shadwell was accused of raping and murdering a young white woman, although there is no evidence to support the accusation. His trial was grossly unfair, and he was executed after an extrajudicial \"trial\" without the due process of law. This incident reflects the broader context of racial injustice and extrajudicial violence against African Americans during that period, particularly in the post-Civil War South.

    "user_input": "What is the theoretical basis of Monetarism?",
    "reference": "modern quantity theory",
    "response": "Monetarism is an economic theory that emphasizes the role of governments in controlling the amount of money in circulation. It was most notably developed by Milton Friedman in the 20th century. The theoretical basis of monetarism includes the following key elements:\n\n1. Quantity Theory of Money: Monetarists rely on the Quantity Theory of Money, which states that there is a direct relationship between the quantity of money in an economy and the level of prices of goods and services sold. The theory is often expressed in the equation of exchange: MV = PT, where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and T is the volume of transactions.\n\n2. Constant Velocity of Money: Monetarists generally assume that the velocity of money (V) is relatively stable over time, which means that changes in the money supply are directly related to changes in the price level (inflation or deflation) and changes in the output of goods and services (real GDP).\n\n3. Long-Run Neutrality of Money: According to monetarism, changes in the money supply primarily affect prices in the long run and do not have a significant impact on real variables like output and employment. In other words, in the long run, the economy is at full employment, and monetary policy can only affect inflation.\n\n4. Control of Inflation: Monetarists argue that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. They believe that controlling the growth rate of the money supply is crucial in maintaining price stability. By keeping the money supply growth rate at a stable and predictable level, inflation can be kept in check.\n\n5. Monetary Policy Rules: Friedman advocated for a rule-based approach to monetary policy, rather than discretionary policy. He proposed that the central bank should focus on maintaining a steady growth rate of the money supply, rather than trying to target short-term economic outcomes like inflation or unemployment.\n\n6. Natural Rate of Unemployment: Friedman introduced the concept of the natural rate of unemployment, which is the level of unemployment consistent with a stable inflation rate. He argued that attempts to reduce unemployment below this natural rate by using expansionary monetary policy would only lead to accelerating inflation.\n\n7. Limited Role of Fiscal Policy: Monetarists believe that fiscal policy (government spending and taxation) has limited effectiveness in influencing the economy in the long run. They argue that fiscal policy can only have a temporary impact on output and employment, and that monetary policy should be the primary tool for managing the economy.\n\nIn summary, monetarism places a strong emphasis on the role of the money supply in determining inflation and advocates for a rule-based, steady, and predictable growth of the money supply as a means to maintain price stability and achieve long-run economic growth.",

      "\n\nMilton Friedman: Friedman was also known for his work on the consumption function, the permanent income hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. \nThis work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. \nWindfall gains would mostly be saved. \nTax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. \nOther important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). \nThis critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. \nUnemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, but in the long run unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market. \nFriedman was best known for reviving interest in the money supply as a determinant of the nominal value of output, that is, the quantity theory of money. \nMonetarism is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory. \nIts origins can be traced back to the 16th-century School of Salamanca or even further; however, Friedman's contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization.

      "\n\nLion: Early phylogenetic research was focused on East and Southern African lions, and already showed they can possibly be divided in two main clades; one to the west and the other to the east of the East African Rift. \nLions in eastern Kenya are genetically much closer to lions in Southern Africa than to lions in Aberdare National Park in western Kenya. \nIn a subsequent study, tissue and bone samples of 32 lion specimens in museums were used. \nResults indicated lions form three phylogeographic groups: one each in Asia and North Africa, in Central Africa and in Southern Africa. \nUp to 480 lion samples from up to 22 countries were analysed in subsequent phylogenetic studies, with results indicating two main evolutionary lion groups.Samples of 53 lions, both wild and captive, from 15 countries were used for phylogenetic analysis. \nResults showed little genetic diversity among lion samples from Asia and West and Central Africa, whereas samples from East and Southern Africa revealed numerous mutations supporting this group having a longer evolutionary history. \nResults of subsequent phylogeographic research indicate that the lion diverged into northern (North and West African and Asian) and southern (East and Southern African) lineages about 245,000 years ago.

      "\n\nHabitat loss and conflicts with humans are considered to be the most significant threats to the species.The Ewaso Lions Project protects lions in the Samburu National Reserve, Buffalo Springs National Reserve and Shaba National Reserve of the Ewaso Ng'iro ecosystem in northern Kenya. \nOutside these areas, the problems arising from lions' interaction with humans and their livestock usually results in the killing of the lions.Zambia's Kafue National Park is a key refuge for lions where frequent, uncontrolled bushfires combined with hunting of lions and prey species limits the ability of the lion population to recover. \nWhen favourable habitat is inundated in the wet season, lions expand home ranges and travel greater distances, and cub mortality is high.In 2015, a population of up to 200 lions that was previously thought to have been extirpated was filmed in the Alatash National Park, Ethiopia, close to the Sudanese border. \nSingapore derives its name from the Malay words singa (lion) and pora (city/fortress), which in turn is from the Tamil-Sanskrit சிங்க singa सिंह siṃha and पुर புர pura, which is cognate to the Greek πόλις, pólis.

      "\n\nManeless lions have also been reported in Senegal, in Sudan's Dinder National Park and in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya. \nThe original male white lion from Timbavati was also maneless. \nThe hormone testosterone has been linked to mane growth; castrated lions often have little to no mane because the removal of the gonads inhibits testosterone production. \nIncreased testosterone may be the cause of maned lionesses reported in northern Botswana.Cave paintings of extinct Eurasian cave lions almost exclusively show hunting animals without a mane; some suggest that this is evidence that they were indeed maneless. \nBecause the hunting usually involved groups of lionesses, however, this presumption remains unproven. \nIn the Chauvet Cave is a sketchy drawing of two maneless lions. \nOne lion is mostly obscured by the other. \nThe lion's mane may have evolved around 320,000–190,000 years ago."

People would pay a small admission fee to view the lions and other animals, but the lions themselves were not bred or kept for consumption.

      "\n\nIn England, although the seraglio tradition was less developed, lions were kept at the Tower of London in a seraglio established by King John in the 13th century; this was probably stocked with animals from an earlier menagerie started in 1125 by Henry I at his hunting lodge in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, where according to William of Malmesbury lions had been stocked.Seraglios served as expressions of the nobility's power and wealth; animals – particularly big cats and elephants – symbolised power and were pitted against each other or domesticated animals in fights. \nBy extension, menageries and seraglios served as demonstrations of the dominance of humanity over nature; the defeat of such natural \"lords\" by a cow in 1682 astonished spectators and the flight of an elephant before a rhinoceros drew jeers. \nThe frequency of such fights slowly declined in the 17th century with the spread of menageries and their appropriation by commoners. \nThe tradition of keeping big cats as pets lasted into the 19th century, at which time it was seen as highly eccentric.The presence of lions at the Tower of London was intermittent, being restocked when a monarch or his consort, such as Margaret of Anjou the wife of Henry VI, either sought or were given animals. \nRecords indicate animals in the Tower of London were kept in poor conditions in the 17th century, in contrast to more open conditions in Florence at the time.

The concept of keeping wild animals in captivity for entertainment or display dates back to ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Persia. These early \"zoos\" were essentially menageries, where exotic animals were kept by royalty and the elite.\n\nThe modern zoo, however, began to take shape in Europe during the 18th century. The first public zoo, known as the \"menagerie,\" was established in Paris, France, in 1793. This was followed by the creation of zoos in other European cities, including London (London Zoo, 1828), Amsterdam (Amsterdam Zoo, 1830), and Berlin (Berlin Zoo, 1844).\n\nThese European zoos were heavily influenced by the Enlightenment ideals of the time, which emphasized the importance of education and the natural world. Zoos were seen as places where people could learn about different species and the wonders of nature. Over time, the focus of zoos shifted from simply displaying exotic animals for entertainment to also including conservation and education efforts.\n\nThe concept of zoos spread from Europe to other parts of the world, including North and South America, Asia, and Africa. Today, zoos can be found on every continent, and many are involved in global conservation efforts to protect endangered species and their habitats.",

      "\n\nAccording to the Malay Annals, this name was given by a fourteenth-century Sumatran Malay prince Sang Nila Utama, who, on alighting the island after a thunderstorm, spotted an auspicious beast that appeared to be a lion on the shore.The lion is a common motif in Chinese art; it was first used in art during the late Spring and Autumn period (fifth or sixth century BC) and became more popular during the Han Dynasty (206 BC – AD 220) when imperial guardian lions started to be placed in front of imperial palaces for protection. \nBecause lions have never been native to China, early depictions were somewhat unrealistic; after the introduction of Buddhist art to China in the Tang Dynasty after the sixth century AD, lions were usually depicted wingless with shorter, thicker bodies and curly manes. \nThe lion dance is a traditional dance in Chinese culture in which performers in lion costumes mimic a lion's movements, often with musical accompaniment from cymbals, drums and gongs. \nThey are performed at Chinese New Year, the August Moon Festival and other celebratory occasions for good luck. \nThe first European \"zoos\" spread among noble and royal families in the 13th century, and until the 17th century were called seraglios; at that time they came to be called menageries, an extension of the cabinet of curiosities. \nThey spread from France and Italy during the Renaissance to the rest of Europe.

      "\n\nThe 1960s saw the appearance of the Kenyan lioness Elsa in the movie Born Free, which is based on the factual book of the same title. \nThe lion's role as king of the beasts has been used in cartoons, such as the 1994 Disney animated feature film The Lion King, the 2005 DreamWorks animated character Alex in Madagascar, and the 2006 Disney animated character Samson in The Wild. \nLions are part of a group of exotic animals that have been central to zoo exhibits since the late 18th century; members of this group are invariably large vertebrates and include elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, large primates and other big cats; zoos sought to gather as many of these species as possible. \nAlthough many modern zoos are more selective about their exhibits, there are more than 1,000 African and 100 Asiatic lions in zoos and wildlife parks around the world. \nThey are considered an ambassador species and are kept for tourism, education and conservation purposes. \nLions can reach an age of over 20 years in captivity; Apollo, a resident lion of Honolulu Zoo in Honolulu, Hawaii, died at age 22 in August 2007. \nHis two sisters, born in 1986, were still alive in August 2007.",
      "\n\nThe menagerie was open to the public by the 18th century; admission was a sum of three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog for feeding to the lions. \nA rival menagerie at the Exeter Exchange also exhibited lions until the early 19th century. \nThe Tower menagerie was closed by William IV, and the animals were transferred to London Zoo, which opened to the public on 27 April 1828.\nThe trade in wild animals flourished alongside improved colonial trade of the 19th century; lions were considered fairly common and inexpensive. \nAlthough they would barter higher than tigers, they were less costly than larger or more difficult-to-transport animals such as the giraffe and hippopotamus, and much less than giant pandas. \nLike other animals, lions were seen as little more than a natural, boundless commodity that was mercilessly exploited with terrible losses in capture and transportation.Lions were kept in cramped and squalid conditions at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages was built in the 1870s. \nFurther changes took place in the early 20th century when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures with concrete \"rocks\", more open space and a moat instead of bars, more closely resembling a natural habitat. \nHagenbeck designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo; although his designs were popular, the use of bars and caged enclosures prevailed in many zoos until the 1960s.

      "\n\nAlexander Pope: Alexander Pope (21 May 1688 – 30 May 1744)  is regarded as the greatest English poet of his age, the early eighteenth century. \nHe is best known for his satirical and discursive poetry—to include The Rape of the Lock, The Dunciad, and An Essay on Criticism—as well as for his translation of Homer. \nAfter Shakespeare, he is the second most quoted writer in the English language, as per The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, with some of his verses having even become popular idioms in common parlance (e.g., Damning with faint praise). \nIn 1700, his family moved to a small estate at Popeswood in Binfield, Berkshire, close to the royal Windsor Forest. \nThis was due to strong anti-Catholic sentiment and a statute preventing Papists from living within 10 miles (16 km) of London or Westminster. \nPope would later describe the countryside around the house in his poem Windsor Forest. \nPope's formal education ended at this time, and from then on he mostly educated himself by reading the works of classical writers such as the satirists Horace and Juvenal, the epic poets Homer and Virgil, as well as English authors such as Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare and John Dryden.  \nHe also studied many languages and read works by English, French, Italian, Latin, and Greek poets.

Here are some key challenges contributing to this disparity:\n\n1. **Funding and Sponsorship**: There is a significant funding gap between the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The Olympics receive substantial financial support from various sources, including governments, broadcasters, and sponsors, while the Paralympics often struggle to secure similar levels of funding. This disparity affects the resources available for athletes, venues, and promotion.\n\n2. **Media Coverage**: Paralympic events typically receive less media coverage compared to the Olympics. This lack of visibility can impact sponsorship opportunities, public interest, and the overall perception of the importance of the Paralympics.\n\n3. **Athlete Support and Facilities**: Non-disabled athletes have access to more advanced training facilities and resources, while Paralympians may face challenges in accessing the same level of support and infrastructure. This can affect their training, preparation, and overall performance.\n\n4. **Public Perception and Awareness**: Despite growing awareness, there are still societal attitudes and misconceptions about the capabilities of athletes with disabilities. Increasing public recognition and understanding can help drive greater support and equality.\n\n5. **Policy and Governance**: Differences in governance and policy between the Olympic and Paralympic committees can lead to variations in how athletes are supported and treated. Efforts are ongoing to bridge these gaps and promote greater parity.\n\n6. **Economic Factors**: The commercialization of sports and the financial interests of sponsors and broadcasters can influence the allocation of resources. Ensuring that Paralympic athletes receive equal consideration requires ongoing advocacy and negotiation.\n\nEfforts are continuously being made to address these issues and promote greater equality between Paralympians and their Olympic counterparts.

",
      "\n\nThe three main lineages are the Ratufinae (Oriental giant squirrels), Sciurillinae and all other subfamilies. \nThe Ratufinae contain a mere handful of living species in tropical Asia. \nThe neotropical pygmy squirrel of tropical South America is the sole living member of the Sciurillinae. \nThe third lineage, by far the largest, has a near-cosmopolitan distribution. \nThis further supports the hypothesis that the common ancestor of all squirrels, living and fossil, lived in North America, as these three most ancient lineages seem to have radiated from there; if squirrels had originated in Eurasia, for example, one would expect quite ancient lineages in Africa, but African squirrels seem to be of more recent origin.The main group of squirrels also can be split into three subgroups, which yield the remaining subfamilies. \nThe Sciurinae contains the flying squirrels (Pteromyini) and the Sciurini, which among others contains the American tree squirrels; the former have often been considered a separate subfamily, but are now seen as a tribe of the Sciurinae. ",
      "\n\nThe pine squirrels (Tamiasciurus), on the other hand, are usually included with the main tree squirrel lineage, but appear to be about as distinct as the flying squirrels; hence, they are sometimes considered a distinct tribe, Tamiasciurini.Two of the three subfamilies are of about equal size, containing between nearly 70 and 80 species each; the third is about twice as large. \nThe Sciurinae contains arboreal (tree-living) squirrels, mainly of the Americas and to a lesser extent Eurasia. \nThe Callosciurinae is most diverse in tropical Asia and contains squirrels that are also arboreal, but have a markedly different habitus and appear more \"elegant\", an effect enhanced by their often very colorful fur. \nThe Xerinae—the largest subfamily—are made up from the mainly terrestrial (ground-living) forms and include the large marmots and the popular prairie dogs, among others, as well as the tree squirrels of Africa; they tend to be more gregarious than other squirrels, which do not usually live together in close-knit groups."

      "\n\nMary Anning: Anning's discoveries became key pieces of evidence for extinction. \nGeorges Cuvier had argued for the reality of extinction in the late 1790s based on his analysis of fossils of mammals such as mammoths. \nNevertheless, until the early 1820s it was still believed by many scientifically literate people that just as new species did not appear, so existing ones did not become extinct—in part because they felt that extinction would imply that God's creation had been imperfect; any oddities found were explained away as belonging to animals still living somewhere in an unexplored region of the Earth. \nThe bizarre nature of the fossils found by Anning, — some, such as the plesiosaur, so unlike any known living creature — struck a major blow against this idea.The ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and pterosaur she found, along with the first dinosaur fossils which were discovered by Gideon Mantell and William Buckland during the same period, showed that during previous eras the Earth was inhabited by creatures very different from those living today, and provided important support for another controversial suggestion of Cuvier's: that there had been an \"age of reptiles\" when reptiles rather than mammals had been the dominant form of animal life. ",
      "\n\nThis phrase became popular after the publication in 1831 of a paper by Mantell entitled \"The Age of Reptiles\" that summarised the evidence that there had been an extended geological era when giant reptiles has swarmed the land, air, and sea. \nThese discoveries also played a key role in the development of a new discipline of geohistorical analysis within geology in the 1820s that sought to understand the history of the Earth by using evidence from fossils to reconstruct extinct organisms and the environments in which they lived. \nThis discipline eventually came to be called palaeontology. \nIllustrations of scenes from \"deep time\" (now known as palaeoart), such as Henry De la Beche's ground-breaking painting Duria Antiquior, helped convince people that it was possible to understand life in the distant past. \nDe la Beche had been inspired to create the painting by a vivid description of the food chain of the Lias by William Buckland that was based on analysis of coprolites. \nThe study of coprolites, pioneered by Anning and Buckland, would prove to be a valuable tool for understanding ancient ecosystems.",
      "\n\nManeless lions have also been reported in Senegal, in Sudan's Dinder National Park and in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya. \nThe original male white lion from Timbavati was also maneless. \nThe hormone testosterone has been linked to mane growth; castrated lions often have little to no mane because the removal of the gonads inhibits testosterone production. \nIncreased testosterone may be the cause of maned lionesses reported in northern Botswana.Cave paintings of extinct Eurasian cave lions almost exclusively show hunting animals without a mane; some suggest that this is evidence that they were indeed maneless. \nBecause the hunting usually involved groups of lionesses, however, this presumption remains unproven. \nIn the Chauvet Cave is a sketchy drawing of two maneless lions. \nOne lion is mostly obscured by the other. \nThe lion's mane may have evolved around 320,000–190,000 years ago."

Studies of her lesser-known works, such as the travel book Rambles in Germany and Italy (1844) and the biographical articles for Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia (1829–1846), support the growing view that Mary Shelley remained a political radical throughout her life. Mary Shelley's works often argue that cooperation and sympathy, particularly as practised by women in the family, were the ways to reform civil society.

      "\n\nMilky Way: Globular clusters are among the oldest objects in the Milky Way, which thus set a lower limit on the age of the Milky Way. \nThe ages of individual stars in the Milky Way can be estimated by measuring the abundance of long-lived radioactive elements such as thorium-232 and uranium-238, then comparing the results to estimates of their original abundance, a technique called nucleocosmochronology. \nThese yield values of about 12.5 ± 3 billion years for CS 31082-001 and 13.8 ± 4 billion years for BD +17° 3248. \nOnce a white dwarf is formed, it begins to undergo radiative cooling and the surface temperature steadily drops. \nBy measuring the temperatures of the coolest of these white dwarfs and comparing them to their expected initial temperature, an age estimate can be made. \nWith this technique, the age of the globular cluster M4 was estimated as 12.7 ± 0.7 billion years. \nAge estimates of the oldest of these clusters gives a best fit estimate of 12.6 billion years, and a 95% confidence upper limit of 16 billion years.In November 2018, astronomers reported the discovery of one of the oldest stars in the universe. \nAbout 13.5 billion-years-old, 2MASS J18082002-5104378 B is a tiny ultra metal-poor (UMP) star made almost entirely of materials released from the Big Bang, and is possibly one of the very first stars.

      "\n\nFrench colonial empire: In the middle of the 18th century, a series of colonial conflicts began between France and Britain, which ultimately resulted in the destruction of most of the first French colonial empire and the near-complete expulsion of France from the Americas. These wars were the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the American Revolution (1765–1783), the French Revolutionary Wars (1793–1802) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815). It may even be seen further back in time to the first of the French and Indian Wars. This cyclic conflict is sometimes known as the Second Hundred Years' War. The French colonial empire began to fall during the Second World War, when various parts were occupied by foreign powers (Japan in Indochina, Britain in Syria, Lebanon, and Madagascar, the United States and Britain in Morocco and Algeria, and Germany and Italy in Tunisia). However, control was gradually reestablished by Charles de Gaulle. The French Union, included in the Constitution of 1946, nominally replaced the former colonial empire, but officials in Paris remained in full control. The colonies were given local assemblies with only limited local power and budgets.

      "\n\nEmirate of Crete: A group of Berbers Andalusians exiles led by Abu Hafs Umar al-Iqritishi conquered Crete sometime c. 824 or in the year 827/828, and established an independent Islamic state. \nThe Byzantines  launched a campaign that took most of the island back in 842 and 843 under Theoktistos, but the reconquest was not completed and was soon reversed. \nLater attempts by the Byzantine Empire to recover the island failed, and for the approximately 135 years of its existence, the emirate was one of the major foes of Byzantium. \nCrete commanded the sea lanes of the Eastern Mediterranean and functioned as a forward base and haven for Muslim corsair fleets that ravaged the Byzantine-controlled shores of the Aegean Sea. \nThe emirate's internal history is less well-known, but all accounts point to considerable prosperity deriving not only from piracy but also from extensive trade and agriculture. \nThe emirate was brought to an end by Nikephoros Phokas, who launched a huge campaign against it in 960–961. \nCretan piracy reached another high in the 930s and 940s, devastating southern Greece, Athos, and the western coasts of Asia Minor. \nAs a result, Emperor Constantine VII (r. 913–959) sent another expedition in 949.

      "\n\nThis date is sometimes confused with the public availability of the first web servers, which had occurred months earlier. \nAs another example of such confusion, several news media reported that the first photo on the Web was published by Berners-Lee in 1992, an image of the CERN house band Les Horribles Cernettes taken by Silvano de Gennaro; Gennaro has disclaimed this story, writing that media were \"totally distorting our words for the sake of cheap sensationalism\".\nThe first server outside Europe was installed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in Palo Alto, California, to host the SPIRES-HEP database. \nAccounts differ substantially as to the date of this event. \nThe World Wide Web Consortium's timeline says December 1992, whereas SLAC itself claims December 1991, as does a W3C document titled A Little History of the World Wide Web. \nThe underlying concept of hypertext originated in previous projects from the 1960s, such as the Hypertext Editing System (HES) at Brown University, Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu, and Douglas Engelbart's oN-Line System (NLS). \nBoth Nelson and Engelbart were in turn inspired by Vannevar Bush's microfilm-based memex, which was described in the 1945 essay \"As We May Think\".\nBerners-Lee's breakthrough was to marry hypertext to the Internet. ",
      "\n\nIn his book Weaving The Web, he explains that he had repeatedly suggested that a marriage between the two technologies was possible to members of both technical communities, but when no one took up his invitation, he finally assumed the project himself. \nIn the process, he developed three essential technologies: the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).\nThe World Wide Web had several differences from other hypertext systems available at the time. \nThe Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. \nIt also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of link rot. \nUnlike predecessors such as HyperCard, the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. \nOn 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due. \nComing two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the Gopher protocol was no longer free to use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and towards the Web. \nAn early popular web browser was ViolaWWW for Unix and the X Window System."

This can contribute to income inequality, as high-skilled workers in developed countries are able to command higher wages while low-skilled workers in developing countries may struggle to find well-paying jobs.\n\n3. Tax policies: Tax policies that favor the wealthy, such as lower tax rates for high-income earners and corporations, can contribute to income inequality. These policies may result in a more concentrated distribution of wealth, as the rich are able to accumulate and retain more of their income.\n\n4. Education: Access to quality education can play a significant role in determining an individual's earning potential. Those who do not have access to quality education may be at a disadvantage in the job market, which can result in lower earning potential and perpetuate the cycle of poverty.\n\n5. Wage stagnation: Over the past few decades, wages for many workers have stagnated, while the cost of living has continued to rise. This has resulted in a growing gap between those who earn high incomes and those who earn low incomes.\n\n6. Wealth inequality: The concentration of wealth in the hands of a small number of individuals or families can lead to increased political and economic power, which can further exacerbate income inequality.\n\n7. Labor market changes: Changes in the labor market, such as the decline of unions and the rise of gig economy jobs, can contribute to income inequality. Unions have historically played a role in advocating for higher wages and better working conditions for workers, while the gig economy often lacks the protections and benefits associated with traditional employment.\n\n8. Geographic disparities: Economic opportunities can vary widely by region, leading to disparities in income and wealth. For example, urban areas may have more job opportunities and higher-paying jobs than rural areas, leading to greater income inequality within a country.\n\n9. Changes in labor force participation: Changes in the composition of the labor force, such as the increase in women entering the workforce, can also contribute to income inequality. For example, women may face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities, which can limit their earning potential.\n\n10. Government policies: Government policies, such as social welfare programs, minimum wage laws, and progressive taxation, can help to address income inequality. However, if these policies are not implemented effectively, they may not have the desired impact on reducing income inequality.\n\nIt's important to note that addressing economic inequality requires a multifaceted approach that considers a range of factors and potential solutions.",

      "\n\nIntellectual property: Intellectual property (IP) is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect. \nIntellectual property encompasses two types of rights: industrial property rights (trademarks, patents, designations of origin, industrial designs and models) and copyright. \nIt was not until the 19th century that the term \"intellectual property\" began to be used, and not until the late 20th century that it became commonplace in the majority of the world.The main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods. \nTo achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create, usually for a limited period of time.  \nThis gives economic incentive for their creation, because it allows people to profit from the information and intellectual goods they create. \nThese economic incentives are expected to stimulate innovation and contribute to the technological progress of countries, which depends on the extent of protection granted to innovators.The intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods.  \nUnlike traditional property, intellectual property is \"indivisible\" – an unlimited number of people can \"consume\" an intellectual good without it being depleted.

It features an ensemble cast, including five Academy Award winners: Gene Hackman; Ernest Borgnine; Jack Albertson; Shelley Winters; and Red Buttons. Parts of the movie were filmed aboard the RMS Queen Mary. The plot centers on the fictional SS Poseidon, an aged luxury liner on her final voyage from New York City to Athens before being sent to the scrapyard. On New Year's Eve, she is overturned by a tsunami. Passengers and crew are trapped inside, and a rebellious preacher attempts to lead a small group of survivors to safety.It is in the vein of other all-star disaster films of the early-mid 1970s such as Airport (1970), Earthquake (1974), and The Towering Inferno (1974).

This means that at some point in its history, Enceladus may have experienced a situation where its spin axis wobbled or \"librated\" with a specific periodicity relative to its orbit around Saturn. However, the term \"voluntary spin orbit liberation\" is not standard in celestial mechanics, and it seems to be a misinterpretation. What is likely meant here is \"forced spin-orbit libration,\" which refers to a gravitational interaction between a moon and its planet that can cause the moon's rotational axis to wobble or librate in a specific way. This can happen when a moon has an orbital period that is a simple fraction of its rotational period, leading to gravitational forces that can affect the moon's rotation and orientation. In the case of Enceladus, it is in a 2:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with Dione, which means Enceladus completes two orbits around Saturn for every one orbit completed by Dione.

This principle leads to several consequences that differ from classical Newtonian mechanics, such as time dilation (moving clocks tick slower), length contraction (moving objects are shorter in the direction of motion), and the relativity of simultaneity (events that are simultaneous for one observer may not be for another).\n\nThe Lorentz transformations that relate the space and time coordinates of events as seen in different inertial frames (frames of reference moving at constant velocities relative to each other) are a mathematical representation of this symmetry. These transformations ensure that the speed of light remains constant in all inertial frames and that the laws of physics, including the speed of light, are the same for all observers.\n\nIn summary, the \"special relativity of movements\" in symmetry refers to the invariance of physical laws under Lorentz transformations, which ensure the constancy of the speed of light and the equivalence of physical laws for all observers in uniform motion.",

Although in a frame in which the interferometer is in motion, the transverse beam must traverse a longer, diagonal path with respect to the non-moving frame thus making its travel time longer, the factor by which the longitudinal beam would be delayed by taking times L/(c-v) & L/(c+v) for the forward and reverse trips respectively is even longer. Therefore, in the longitudinal direction the interferometer is supposed to be contracted, in order to restore the equality of both travel times in accordance with the negative experimental result(s).

    "response": "When an object is in free fall, it means that the only force acting upon it is gravity. This causes the object to accelerate towards the ground or any other massive body, creating a motion that appears as if it's falling freely. In many cases, this is observed when an object is dropped, and it seems to fall straight down without any other forces acting on it, such as air resistance, playing a significant role.\n\nIn a more technical sense, an object is considered to be in free fall when the only force acting on it is the gravitational force. This results in the object having an acceleration equal to the acceleration due to gravity (g, approximately 9.81 m/s² on Earth), which causes the object to move with a constant velocity (ignoring air resistance). So, in the context of physics, an object in free fall is said to be in free fall because gravity is the sole force acting on it, leading to its acceleration.\n\nIt's important to note that even when an object is in free fall, it still has a velocity and a trajectory. For example, if an object is dropped from a moving vehicle, it initially has the horizontal velocity of the vehicle in addition to the vertical acceleration due to gravity. Its trajectory will be a parabolic path, not a straight line, due to the influence of gravity. However, the key point is that the vertical motion is solely due to the force of gravity, and that's why it's considered to be in free fall.",

      "\n\nFifth force: A new fundamental force might be difficult to test. Gravity, for example, is such a weak force that the gravitational interaction between two objects is only significant when one of them has a great mass. Therefore, it takes very sensitive equipment to measure gravitational interactions between objects that are small compared to the Earth. A new (or \"fifth\") fundamental force might similarly be weak and therefore difficult to detect. Nonetheless, in the late 1980s a fifth force, operating on municipal scales (i.e. with a range of about 100 meters), was reported by researchers (Fischbach et al.) who were reanalyzing results of Loránd Eötvös from earlier in the century. The force was believed to be linked with hypercharge. Over a number of years, other experiments have failed to duplicate this result.There are at least three kinds of searches that can be undertaken, which depend on the kind of force being considered, and its range. Some speculative theories have proposed a fifth force to explain various anomalous observations that do not fit existing theories.  The characteristics of this fifth force depend on the theory being advanced. Many postulate a force roughly the strength of gravity (i.e. it is much weaker than electromagnetism or the nuclear forces) with a range of anywhere from less than a millimeter to cosmological scales. Another proposal is a new weak force, mediated by W′ and Z′ bosons.",

      "\n\nKyrgyzstan: Kyrgyz is a Turkic language of the Kipchak branch, closely related to Kazakh, Karakalpak, and Nogay Tatar. \nIt was written in the Arabic alphabet until the twentieth century. \nLatin script was introduced and adopted in 1928, and was subsequently replaced on Stalin's orders by Cyrillic script in 1941. \nMany business and political affairs are carried out in Russian. \nUntil recently, Kyrgyz remained a language spoken at home and was rarely used during meetings or other events. \nHowever, most parliamentary meetings today are conducted in Kyrgyz, with simultaneous interpretation available for those not speaking Kyrgyz. \nSince independence, the sovereign state has officially been a unitary parliamentary republic, although it continues to endure ethnic conflicts, revolts, economic troubles, transitional governments and political conflict. \nKyrgyzstan is a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Eurasian Economic Union, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Turkic Council, the Türksoy community and the United Nations. \nThe climate varies regionally. \nThe low-lying Fergana Valley in the southwest is subtropical and extremely hot in summer, with temperatures reaching 40 °C (104 °F) The northern foothills are temperate and the Tian Shan varies from dry continental to polar climate, depending on elevation.
